"BUD, a nascent app taking a shot at creating a metaverse for Gen Z to play and interact with each other, has raised another round of funding in three months.
The Singapore-based startup told TechCrunch that it has closed $36.8 million in a Series B round led by Sequoia Capital India, not long after it secured a Series A extension in February. The new infusion brings BUD’s total financing to over $60 million.
As with BUD’s previous rounds, this round of raise attracted a handful of prominent China-focused investors — ClearVue Partners, NetEase and Northern Light Venture Capital. Its existing investors GGV Capital, Qiming Venture Partners and Source Code Capital also participated in the round.
Founded by two former Snap engineers Risa Feng and Shawn Lin in 2019, BUD lets users create bulbous 3D characters, cutesy virtual assets and richly colored experiences through drag-and-drop and without any coding background.
The company declined to reveal its active user size but said its users have created over 15 million custom experiences i.e., virtual spaces with gameplay that others can join since the app launched in November. Virtual assets, including costumes and accessories that users design for characters, have changed hands more than 150 million times on BUD’s marketplace.
These transactions are clearly a promising way to generate revenues, but BUD is not charging commissions for now. Nor has it started monetizing in other means via the app.
Perhaps partly due to its free-to-use and ad-free nature, the app has been among the top 10 social apps in nearly 40 countries across North America, Southeast Asia and South America. It’s currently the top free social Android app in Thailand and Vietnam, according to market intelligence company SensorTower.
Apps like Roblox and South Korea’s Zepeto have also made it easier for anyone to design virtual characters and spaces. BUD is taking the user experience a step further with plans to introduce a marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). That means the ownership of virtual items sold on BUD will be recorded on the blockchain. Reselling of digital assets will likely become possible in the form of NFTs, of which authenticity and provenance can be more easily verified.
BUD declined to disclose which chain the NFT project will be on or what tokens it will use, but said the marketplace will “soon be live.”
“While BUD makes 3D content creation possible for mainstream Gen Z consumers, we will continue to bring blockchain to mainstream consumers and allow our creators to truly own and monetize their creations,” said Lin in a statement.
The company is quickly expanding and has a team of 130 employees spread across its headquarters in Singapore as well as its offices in Shenzhen and the U.S.

"Founders have gotten the memo that the ground is shifting under their feet right now. What to do about it is the question. Already, teams are making plans to scale back their spending to preserve capital. They’re making painful staff cuts toward that same end — or else instituting hiring freezes.
But they should also be thinking a lot harder about building relationships with bankers and the larger companies that might conceivably be interested in acquiring their startup, say two attorneys who work on both the ‘buy’ and ‘sell’ side of transactions, with both large companies and venture-backed outfits, and who both have more than 20 years of experience.
Indeed, to better understand some of the options founders may have, we talked earlier today with Denny Kwon and Scott Anthony, both of whom represent the white shoe law firm Covington & Burling (where former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is also an attorney). They answered a range of questions that we thought startups might be wondering about right now. Our chat has been edited lightly for length.
TC: How much has the world changed in the last few weeks?
DK: There is certainly a feeling of more pressure on sellers to get deals done as quickly as possible in light of the fact that there’s a lot of market volatility right now and they don’t know how buyers may be reacting to a significant decline in their stock price. Smaller companies are also facing the prospect of a slightly more challenging fundraising market, so alternatives for them are narrowing.
TC: Given that public shares are so volatile right now, are acquirers more or less inclined to offer equity as a component of a deal? 
DK: It’s much more challenging to price deals with a significant stock component in this market. With any volatility, you don’t get a clear sense of the inherent value of a share, so all-cash deals are much more favorable to targets.
TC: Are targets in a position right now to make demands? How much leverage does a startup with dwindling options really have?
DK: Whenever we see volatile markets, where valuations were incredibly high [and are] being reset, it always takes time for sellers’ expectations to reset as well, so although they may be a temporary [lull in activity] because of the market, if there’s a ‘normalization’ that’s to come, we’ll probably see M&A activity, especially where valuation expectations are reduced on both the buyers’ and the sellers’ side.
My sense [right now] is that buyers may view the market correction as being potentially opportunistic but sellers may not have the same expectations because they may hope for a rebound in the near future. Once seller expectations come down and they continue to hear from VCs that funding may not be as available as it was 6 to 12 months ago, they’ll be even harder pressed to turn away acquisition offers that come in.
TC: Are you seeing deals being yanked as buyers look to reprice earlier agreements to their benefit?
DK: The pending deals I’m working on are continuing apace.
TC: We’re all hearing — and reading — about very steep valuation drops already. Do you have any sense of how much value your clients have lost in recent weeks or whether certain sectors are getting hit harder than others?
SA:There’s valuation pressure, but it’s hard to gauge [the degree]. Certainly, we have companies that were racing to close valuations [before Russia invaded Ukraine] and [that period since] has changed everyone’s expectations. I think there’s concern on the company side that investors are sitting out and that’s driving valuations down.
Companies with revenues and good prospects will weather any downturn better — they always have. Sector wise, it will depend, but the whole stablecoin [debacle] hasn’t helped the crypto stuff.
TC: How big a concern are antitrust regulators to your bigger clients? 
DK: It’s top of mind for all practitioners, but there’s a dichotomy in that some transactions are reportable and others are not. For those that are reportable — the threshold is approximately $100 million —  we’re spending an incredible amount of time analyzing the potential for regulatory issues.
TC: How long does an M&A process take, and at what point do both sides agree on a price?
DK: From that initial approach from an acquirer, the time period can vary from a few weeks if there is alignment right away, up to several months if the target company wants to see if there is other interest. A lot depends on how compelling that first offer may appear. Once you get to a handshake on a valuation, it’s usually a six- to eight-week process to get a signed definitive agreement.
SA: If the [startup] is the one that is making the decision to find a buyer, then the process – maybe they hire bankers, maybe they use board members’ connections to reach out to strategics – the process and timing can be very different depending on how quickly they need the money and how quickly they can get potential buyers interested . . . and the size of the company, but buyers are still going to run their diligence process.
TC: Let’s assume M&A will be a more significant factor, given the cooling funding environment. If you were to advise a startup on the pros and cons about proceeding, what points would you make?
DK: Many companies at an inflection point that need to raise money to fund their growth or expansion are going to have a difficult decision to make, which is to either raise a new round where the valuation may not meet their expectations or [where they see a lot of dilution], or an M&A exit, where they see proceeds now but lose out on [potential] upside.
TC: Should startups that are open to selling be reaching out to anyone, or should they wait to see who approaches them? Some might worry their startup’s value will drop as soon as they indicate a willingness to sell.
DK:  I’d be advising startups to talk to bankers and keep relationships up with people at the larger companies they know simply because we may be in for a longer-term correction, where funding becomes even more challenging than it has been over the last couple of months.
SA: Having relationships with the bankers is prudent so if you have to check the market, you have those relationships already. Also, keeping in contact with customers and bigger strategic partners that would be natural buyers for the company could short-circuit any kind of sale process later.",,,2022-05-20T23:29:49,Why founders should start talking now to bankers and potential buyers

Episode 6: Lightspeed’s web3 guru on consumer crypto startups and the metaverse (with Mercedes Bent)

Welcome back, this week Lucas and Anita discuss the continued fallout from the broader market crash and how life is going for crypto giants on the public markets. We chat about FTX’s 30-year-old billionaire CEO buying up a big chunk of Robinhood, which is pumping the gas on crypto even as the market cools. We also discuss trouble at Coinbase and the continued fallout from the collapse of Terra.
In their interview this week, Lucas and Anita chat with Mercedes Bent. Bent is a venture capitalist at Lightspeed Venture Partners where she places bets on consumer products in cryptoland. Before joining Lightspeed, Bent spent some time in the VR world, so we picked her brain on where crypto fits into this metaverse future everyone is clamoring about.

Episode 518: A Twitter Bot Wrote This


The whole team was back together this week, which was pretty darn good as there was a lot to get through. Alex Wilhelm, Natasha Mascarenhas and Mary Ann Azevedo were on the mic, with Grace handling production.
What did we get into? A better question might be what did we not get into:

We started with an update from the TechCrunch Mobility event, thanks to Natasha who is on-site and up in the air.
From there it was time to talk deals, with the crew parsing Arrived’s latest round, and why Kolkata Chai took some external capital, but very much on its own terms.
Then it was time to chat Zenly’s new mapping news, and why startups are critical when it comes to taking on incumbents.
From there we had to ask if Elon Musk really wants to buy Twitter (seemingly no?), and how tired we are about the topic itself.
Then we chatted through the recent unicorn vibe check that the market got, and the fact that most unicorns are not true IPO candidates. (Along with news from SpotOn, and Unit!)
And to close, we asked about the responsibilities of tech platforms in the wake of a number of mass shootings in the United States; where should our expectations for content moderation on platforms start, and end?

Hugs from us to you, and we will talk to you Monday!
Episode 517: Is there hope for digital health startups post-Roe?


This is our Wednesday show, where we niche down to a single topic, think about a question and unpack the rest. This week, Natasha asked:  How do digital health startups build in a post-Roe world?
The question comes after Natasha’s recent Startups Weekly column, “When your startup’s core mission is set to be overturned.” The piece explores the ripple effects of the looming Roe v. Wade overturn, specifically in how it impacts startups. But, let’s not hypothesize. We brought on Kiki Freedman, the CEO and co-founder of Hey Jane, to answer our big questions about building, raising, and existing when so much regulatory scrutiny is weighing on your business. A direct-to-consumer health company that specializes in the delivery of abortion pills, Hey Jane about to kick off its fundraising process which makes for an interesting tension. The startup – especially today – really sits in the middle of two intense moments: an overturn to Roe v. Wade would threaten all of its work, and a toughening, risk-averse VC market could be a hurdle toward next financing.
Enjoy the show, and let us know if you like this interview format. Also, here’s the Found interview that we referenced during the show as well!
Episode 516: What’s ahead for crypto startups?


Hello and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines. Every Monday, Grace and Alex scour the news and record notes on what’s going on to kick off the week.
What was on our minds this morning? The following:

Global markets are generally down, albeit nothing too terrifying. The American stock market is trying to regain its footing after weeks of selling.
What’s ahead for crypto startups in the wake of the Terra/Luna meltdown? Bloomberg wonders about a general slowdown, and we look at the Crunchbase data of who backed the ill-fated stablecoin.
Startup layoffs are accelerating — not as bad as before, but enough to warrant our attention. Layoffs.FYI is back, y’all!
The Topship round, invested in by Y Combinator and Flexport, has our recent look at CVC hitting just right.

It was an awful weekend in America, which leaked into the show somewhat. Take care of one another.
A few housekeeping notes before we go: This is not a live-show week, so Equity will simply come out on Wednesday and Friday mornings. And this week is our TC Sessions: Mobility event, which you can learn more about here

"Pear, a Palo Alto, Ca.-based venture firm that we’ve been tracking since its outset in 2012, looks to be raising a fourth fund that’s targeting $410 million in capital commitments, shows a new SEC filing.
It would be a big step up from Pear’s first three funds, which closed progressively with $50 million in 2013, $75 million in 2016 and $160 million in capital commitments in 2019, including from a longtime limited partner, the University of Chicago.
Reached for comment, co-founder Pejman Nozad emailed back, “I can’t comment!”
Nozad and co-founder Mar Hershenson have long been the first stop for prominent early-stage investors that are looking to fund nascent teams, given the firm has been among the earliest backers in a notable number of companies that have gone to raise ever-bigger rounds and higher valuations, including the now publicly traded companies DoorDash and Guardant Health.
Other startups to attract capital from Pear before nearly any other firm was aware of their existence include the deep-linking startup Branch, which closed on $300 million in funding in February at a $4 billion valuation; Gusto, valued at $9.5 billion last summer when it raised $175 million in funding; and Aurora Solar, a firm that provides software services for the solar industry and was valued at $4 billion in February when it closed a $200 million round.
Like other firms, Pear is likely to see the valuations of its still-private portfolio companies slide downward — possibly by a lot — depending on how long this correction lasts.
Hershenson, who joined TechCrunch for a mobility-focused event this week, noted on stage that startups are in for a bumpy ride, given how frothy the market had grown.
Asked if the startup party is over, Hershenson answered: “Maybe for a little while it’s over … The problem is that the market was priced too high in 2021, and we’re all adjusting to that price change, and that changes how companies raise money.
“Everybody knows that the stock market is down a lot,” she’d said. “Software stocks are down in some cases 80%. [Meanwhile] if you’re a private company, and you were very lucky and you raised money in 2021, you may have gotten a multiple of 100x on your ARR. Today, those multiples are 10x or 20x. That means that if your company was $2 billion [at the time of your fundraise], your company is [now] worth $200 million.”
Even with a steep reset in prices, however, Pear’s success to date is undeniable. It’s also unlikely.
Nozad, very famously, was earlier a rug dealer who insisted on toting rugs to his clients’ homes, where during the course of long conversations, they would learn about the rug and he would learn about their business. He eventually became a scout for his boss and a trusted friend to some very powerful people.
“He has a good sniffer, and I trust the guy,”  Sequoia’s Doug Leone told Forbes back in 2012. “He’s like me, from the earth.” Sequoia has, in fact, backed a number of companies that Pear has funded, including Guardant Health and DoorDash.
Meanwhile, his partner, Mar Hershenson, was also very much an outlier when the two struck out on their own. Despite founding several companies previously — one of which Nozad backed — and though she holds an M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, she is a native of Spain and even more unusual in VC circles a decade ago, she is a woman who had not previously cut her teeth at someone else’s venture firm.
That may not seem very notable today but in 2012, but it put Hershenson in rare company.
As for the team’s newest bets, Pear hosted an invite-only demo day earlier this week, coverage of which we’ll have for readers soon. (Unlike Y Combinator, the outfit holds a demo day each year for a comparatively limited number of companies — typically around 10.)
In the meantime, some of its other recent checks have gone to Sudozi, a two-year-old Austin, Texas startup that provides a SaaS platform to help enterprises improve their money management capabilities and that just this month announced a $4.3 million seed round led by Pear.
Pear also recently wrote a follow-on check to Osmind, a two-year-old, Bay Area-based startup that makes software to chart and update patient information and documents, with a focus on mental health. The outfit raised $40 million in Series B funding led by DFJ Growth, an announcement it also made earlier this month.

the hottest take
Though crypto markets have been relatively stable since last week’s bombastic dump-o-rama, gloom was on the menu this week for institutional investors and retail buyers prophesying crypto winters falling upon all ye households for the next several years.
The message from VCs to crypto startups and mega corps alike was “cut the fat” — a statement which doesn’t jibe too well with the lavish launch parties and plans to quintuple hiring that plenty of founders seemed to be working toward last month. It’s been a period of unprecedented boom for crypto startups, but life has been looking a bit less pleasant for Coinbase since Bitcoin and the public markets hit their frothy peak in November of last year.
Coinbase is currently trading below $65 per share after a more than 80% decline from its November all-time high. A lot of other public market tech stocks are also feeling the hurt, but relative to just how much revenue Coinbase pulled in last year, it’s clear investors have nuked their expectations for the company’s future performance. Coinbase did $7.4 billion in net revenue in 2021 and is currently rocking a market cap below $14 billion. That’s nuts.
Public market investors may not have the rosiest view of Coinbase, but the question is how this really impacts the company. Well, the firm is adjusting its growth expectations for one thing. COO Emilie Choi announced this week that the company was hitting the brakes, “Heading into this year, we planned to triple the size of the company. Given current market conditions, we feel it’s prudent to slow hiring and reassess…”
This is expected, but isn’t great for a company that has several cash-swolen competitors all chasing their market share. The company has been diversifying its offerings looking to leverage its network and provide more of a browser for the nascent web3 world, but it’s unclear what kind of consumer pickup the crypto world is looking at over the next year compared to the past couple, something which has left the company in a fairly grim position for the near-term…

the latest podcast
Hey, it’s Anita, here to give you an update on our latest episode of Chain Reaction, where we unpack the latest web3 news, block-by-block for the crypto-curious. 
In this episode, we talked about 30-year-old blockchain billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) buying a 7.6% stake in Robinhood and what he could possibly be planning to do to help turn around the struggling exchange amid a rough first half of the year. We also explained the difference between custodial and non-custodial wallets, since Robinhood just announced it’s launching the latter — the latest in a spate of new products intended to attract more users to its platform. 

Since we talked about Robinhood, we had to go over what’s up with its competitor, Coinbase, which said this week that it would be slowing its hiring plans because of the crypto market crash. We also gave listeners an update on the latest with the disgraced UST — the stablecoin that (kind of) started it all.
Our guest this week was Mercedes Bent, an investor at Lightspeed Venture Partners who helped us unpack the loaded term that is the “metaverse” and talked about some of the long-term potential she’s seeing in sectors like web3 video games.

Animoca Brands plans to add education to its multibillion-dollar NFT and gaming business
Animoca Brands has grown into one of the biggest firms in the metaverse, play-to-earn gaming and NFT worlds, but its co-founder Yat Siu told TechCrunch there’s a new sector the company wants to enter: education. No, not education about crypto topics, but more general educational tooling that could apply to more than one discipline. Siu said he hopes to drive the teacher economy with a “learn-to-earn” or “teach-to-earn” model, so both teachers’ and students’ time can be rewarded in the form of a token or cash. This push could be a new wave for the crypto ecosystem to implement additional ways to earn rewards.

“You can often pick up significant market share in an economic downturn by just staying alive,” top startup accelerator Y Combinator wrote in an internal email to its founders this week. The advice was one of 10 bullet points in a memo meant to help its companies navigate the economic downturn crushing tech. Other standout quotes include “plan for the worst” and “no one can predict how bad the economy will get, but things don’t look good.”
The email is a vibe shift from just a few weeks ago, when hundreds of Y Combinator startups — many of which already raised venture funding — presented themselves to the public on Demo Day. The startups were the first to receive Y Combinator’s new $500,000 standard deal and were aggressively focused on international opportunity. Now, after that bonanza, YC is saying that “this slowdown will have a disproportionate impact on international companies” among others.
Y Combinator isn’t the only one publishing a “black swan” memo in preparation for what’s to come. TechCrunch obtained a series of memos that venture capitalist firms sent to portfolio companies about the market downturn. Some were hopeful, some were simple, and others were a vibe check as straightforward as: Can you tell us your ARR and cash burn in writing?

The TechCrunch Top 3

UST UGH: Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon has some ’splaining to do with South Korea’s special financial crimes unit, which has launched an investigation into the collapse of Terraform’s stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and its sister token Luna earlier this month. Prosecutors might be first in line, but the line is growing, with investors filing a lawsuit against Kwon and his co-founder Daniel Shin over alleged charges of fraud and other financial regulation violations. Also joining are Luna Foundation Guard advisors who tell Jacquie that they have not heard from Kwon in weeks.
Standoff: We enjoyed reading Carly’s piece outlining what happened with Costa Rica’s ransomware attacks — the Conti gang is attempting to overthrow the government — and who could be next. As of our newsletter time, the ransom part was still going on. The deadline given was May 23.
Klarna konundrum: The payments company is reportedly the latest to be fine with lowering its valuation, and in its case, there is some capital attached. We think Alex sums it up well saying, “No one likes a down round. They are dilutive, messy and demoralizing. But they are also miles better than not raising money and dying, so companies raise them when required.” He goes into why Klarna taking an insider round with a cut valuation is worth it or not.

Startups and VC
Today, we got a wee bit excited about Haje’s somewhat-expletive-filled rant about Coca-Cola’s new bottle caps that don’t detach from the bottle, against a backdrop of greenwashing.
We also loved Brian’s piece about Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky’s love for small phones. “If no one else makes one I guess I will be forced to make it myself,” Migicovsky laments.
Also, Brian and Haje tag-teamed on a pair of articles about Sony’s new earbuds. Brian covers the buds themselves (“As someone who tests a lot of earbuds over the course of a year, the LinkBuds S are among the best sounding and most comfortable I’ve had in my ears”), and Haje double-clicked on the Endel soundscape-creating app.

Just as a sales team builds and refines its funnel, early stage founders in fundraising mode can create an investor funnel that will help sustain their company for years to come.
Oriana Papin-Zoghbi, CEO and co-founder of women’s health startup AOA Dx, shared her investor breakdown with TC+:

35% private investors
34% women (female investors or female-headed funds)
26% venture capitalists
23% family and friends
18% international investors
15% angel groups

“When building an investor funnel, vocalizing what you want is crucial to finding the right investors,” says Papin-Zoghbi.
“Finding the right investors is like finding the right team members — you need to be upfront about your expectations and address what you want them to bring to the table.”

Deposit 25 cents: If you’re a gamer, we presume you have some thoughts on God of War: Ragnarök. Devin’s take is that this game “may be the most accessible title yet, and that’s saying something.” It’s good to see Microsoft create a game that offers features that are customizable for people with certain specific disabilities, like a visual or hearing impairment.
The family that Snaps together stays together: For every parent dying to know who their teen is interacting with on Snapchat, the social media giant is close to launching its parental control feature, “Family Center.” For those of you not on Snapchat, or don’t have children, Sarah tells us this is important because it is one of the few social networks where you can’t see someone’s friend list.

"As bad economic news piles up seemingly on a daily basis, we don’t know what the future holds except that change is on the way. Although we are seeing layoffs and hiring freezes at some companies, it doesn’t necessarily mean the talent crunch will immediately abate.
There will likely be some lag before we start to see the tight job market we’ve experienced for the last couple of years begin to loosen. Even then, there are certain fields like engineering, data science and cybersecurity, where tech companies large and small could still struggle to find talent no matter what the macroeconomic conditions look like.
Over the last month, we have seen an increase in the number of startup layoff announcements at companies like Cameo, On Deck and Robinhood. Meanwhile, big companies like Netflix, Meta and Uber have announced hiring freezes, with the consumer streaming service throwing some layoffs into the mix as well.
Despite this onslaught of bad news, for now, most startup founders, investors and HR pros don’t see the job market magically improving for hiring departments, at least in the near term. That means the folks in charge of hiring are still going to have to shake the bushes for talent.
Matt Hoffman, partner and head of talent at VC firm M13 and a former HR pro, said for a lot of people, the desire to be a part of something and help it grow is in some ways a stronger motivator than perks and pay. That’s good news for startups looking for talent.
“I’ve always believed that people don’t join a company just for the economic benefits. They join for the opportunity to have an impact and to grow. And so in a lot of cases, it may be a more opportune time to take a chance in an early-stage company because you can focus on that long-term horizon, and you can get that opportunity to grow and have an impact,” Hoffman told me.
For employees, he said there will still be opportunities at good companies in any economic conditions, but attracting talent always comes down to creating a good place to work.
“Even in the tightest of economic environments — and we’re not there yet — there’s always going to be high demand for the best talent. Always. So the things that you need to do to attract, engage and retain these employees does not change,” he said.

"If you’ve been following Netflix lately, then you’d know the streamer is on shaky ground at the moment. Antenna data reveals that Netflix saw 3.6 million subscription cancellations in the first quarter of 2022, over one million more than the company experienced in Q1 2021 and Q4 2021. This is a significant indicator that Netflix is inching closer to losing its top spot in the streaming battle.
While Netflix’s downfall has raised speculations about if the SVOD (subscription video on demand) industry has peaked and is beginning a downward trend, new Antenna data supports the contrary.
Antenna discovered that U.S. Subscriptions in the Premium SVOD category grew +4.0% quarter over quarter and by +24.7% year over year. The research also shows that there were 37.4 million new gross SVOD customers and a loss of 29.8 million subscribers, leaving a gross of just 7.7 million new subscribers in the first quarter of 2022.

The 37.4 number is consistent with the past two quarters yet significantly higher than 2019 (before COVID-19). The growth was largely driven by fledgling services Peacock and Paramount+, which added a combined 6.1 million or more U.S. Subscribers.
In comparison, in 2019, when the market was dominated by Netflix and Hulu (services like Disney+, Peacock and HBO Max didn’t exist yet), there were a total of 10.3 million subscriptions in the year’s first quarter. The massive increase depicts a three-year compound annual growth rate of 54%.
While subscriber growth may be high right now, so are cancellations. There were just under 30 million cancellations in Q1 2022, which is 12% higher than any quarter in history, or 4.5 times the cancel volume seen three years prior, Antenna finds.
The cancellations may not be anything to worry about since the new subscriber additions indicate consumers are bouncing around — also known as churn and return. Paramount+, Peacock and Disney+ accounted for 51% of all new sign-ups in the quarter. Plus, the three mentioned services made up a large portion of new sign-ups for the churned Q1 2022 Netflix users.
Image Credits: Antenna
Peter Fondulas, principal at Hub, stated, “Netflix’s subscriber loss in Q1 of 2022, and its anticipated losses in the following quarters, represent a tiny proportion of its global subscriber base. And in fact, at some point, a service as widely penetrated as Netflix has only so much room left to grow. In our view, it would be a grave mistake to take the Netflix experience as a sign that streaming TV services are on the verge of decline, as some analysts have suggested. The lure of buzzworthy exclusive content, and the sheer convenience of on-demand viewing, are two powerful forces that should keep these services growing at least for the near term.”
In Q1 2022, Netflix reported a loss of 200,000 subscribers, making its first subscriber loss in more than 10 years. The decline brought Netflix’s subscriber base to 221.6 million, down from 221.8 million in the previous quarter. The losses will only continue, according to Netflix forecasts, and the streamer is expected to lose 2 million in the second quarter.
Since Netflix raised prices on all its plan tiers domestically in January 2022, there has been a major jump in subscription cancellations. The Netflix U.S. active monthly churn rate was a little over 2% in January 2019, after it raised subscription prices.
Further, Antenna data shows that Netflix’s active monthly churn rate increased +0.95 pts month over month in January 2022, where a price jump led to an active monthly churn rate of 3%. By the end of March, Netflix’s active monthly churn rate was 3.3%. This suggests that Netflix’s upcoming cheaper ad-supported tier is the company’s plan to minimize churn.

All this data goes to show how volatile the streaming market is. It’s hard to predict which service will be on top next, but established streamers like Netflix need to be on their toes and come up with new strategies to attract new subscribers.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.44-PM.png,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/antenna-streaming-1536x768-1.webp,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-11.49.36-AM.png,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.35-PM.png","https://www.antenna.live/post/netflix-q122-retrospective,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.44-PM.png,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/antenna-streaming-1536x768-1.webp,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-11.49.36-AM.png,https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/new-research-suggests-the-streaming-party-isnt-over,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/19/netflix-shares-down-more-than-20-after-losing-200000-subscribers-in-first-quarter/,https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/netflix-raised-its-prices-again/,https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/netflix-price-hike/,https://www.antenna.live/post/double-click-on-netflix-q122-churned-users,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/netflix-could-introduce-its-ad-supported-plan-as-soon-as-this-year/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.35-PM.png",2022-05-21T14:00:37,Premium streaming subscriptions continue to increase despite Netflix&#8217;s downfall
"Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.
The app industry continues to grow, with a record number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the latest year-end reports. App Annie says global spending across iOS and Google Play is up to $135 billion in 2021, and that figure will likely be higher when its annual report, including third-party app stores in China, is released next year. Consumers also downloaded 10 billion more apps in 2021 than in 2020, reaching nearly 140 billion in new installs, it found.
Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a combined $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors poured $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that was up 27% year-over-year.
This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and much more.

Apps celebrate Global Accessibility Awareness Day
This past Thursday, May 19, 2022, marked the 11th Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD), which is a day focused on raising awareness about digital access and inclusion for the more than 1 billion people who live with disabilities or impairments. A number of app makers and tech companies took part in GAAD this year to either highlight or announce new features designed to better meet the needs of those with vision impairment, hearing loss and other disabilities.
Instagram’s @creators account shared information with its community about how and why to use accessibility features, like alt-text and auto-generated captions to create a better experience for your audience. The company also noted other developments it had rolled out, like dark mode, screen reader improvements, improved automatic and custom alternative text options for people with vision impairments, caption stickers for Reels and Stories, and more. The company also said it has started rolling out closed caption features to improve the Instagram experience for the deaf and hard of hearing communities. These changes help to improve the experience for everyone, however, as Instagram said one-third of video plays on Instagram are with the sound off. In March, Instagram made auto-generated captions the default for creators, which are supported globally across iOS and Android.
Google shared its approach to both hiring people with disabilities and building products to meet their needs. For example, it highlighted projects like Project Relate, a communication tool for people with speech impairments; the update to TalkBack, Android’s built-in screen reader; and the improved Select-to-Speak Chromebook tool; a multi-pin feature for Google Meet, which allows users to pin multiple tiles, like a presenter’s screen and interpreter’s screen. The company also noted all its English-language YouTube Originals content from the past year — and moving forward — will now have English audio descriptions available globally.
Apple, meanwhile, participated in GAAD with a number of announcements about new accessibility features for iPhone, Apple Watch and Mac.
These included a universal Live Captions feature, improved visual and auditory detection modes and iOS access to WatchOS apps. Live Captions will be able to transcribe any audio content, like FaceTime calls, video conferencing apps and streaming video, as well as in-person conversations, all in English to start.

Apple’s Sound Recognition feature will be able to be programmed to recognize sounds unique to a person’s own home, like their doorbell or appliances. The Magnifier app will add a new ML and lidar-powered Door Detection feature within a new Detection Mode section. This will help users locate a door, understand how far they are from it and describe door attributes. Apple Maps will offer sound and haptics feedback for VoiceOver users. And Apple Watch will help users control Apple Watch remotely from their paired iPhone with Apple Watch Mirroring. It also gains new Quick Action like a double-pinch gesture to answer or end a phone call, dismiss a notification, take a photo, play or pause media in the Now Playing app, and start, pause or resume a workout.
Snap’s platform policies for third-party apps aren’t yet fully enforced
Image Credits: TechCrunch
A handful of Snap Kit platform developers have not yet complied with the new guidelines around anonymous messaging and friend-finding apps announced in March. The Snapchat maker revamped its developer platform policies on March 17, 2022, to ban anonymous apps and require developers to build friend-finding apps to limit access to users 18 or older. The policy changes were effective immediately and existing developers were given 30 days to come into compliance — a date that would have passed last month.
It is now mid-May and some developers of the newly banned and restricted apps are not yet meeting Snap’s new requirements.
Snap confirmed to TechCrunch a small number of apps were given extensions, including anonymous apps LMK and Send It. But others seemed to be working around Snap’s ban with their friend-finding apps marketed to users ages 12+, instead of the now required 18+. They got away with this by not actually using the SDK — something impossible to tell from their App Store marketing and screenshots which imply they’re directly integrated with Snap’s features. Another app had flown under the radar, continuing to operate in violation of the rules unless TechCrunch pointed it out, resulting in a belated ban. This lack of clarity on which apps are platform apps, and which are only pretending to be, could complicate things for Snap, which is engaged in litigation over bullying-related suicides. And like all social media, the company could be under new U.S. regulation related to child safety matters in the future, as well.

Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced

Twitter deal still a go… for now
First, Elon Musk tweeted that the Twitter deal was “temporarily on hold” until Twitter could prove the percentage of spambots on its platform was actually less than 5%, as it reports. This Tuesday, he reiterated the deal would not move forward until Twitter would show him proof of this <5% figure. Twitter was having none of it, though. The company filed a proxy statement, saying it’s committed to the deal as agreed and is ready to close “as promptly as possible.”
If Musk’s move was an attempt to renegotiate the price, it didn’t seem to be working. Twitter’s top lawyer and head of policy, Vijaya Gadde, told staff at an all-hands meeting there’s “no such thing as a deal being on hold,” reported Bloomberg. Twitter execs also suggested that it could try to enforce the deal terms in court, if need be, but said that would be “pretty rare” for such a thing to occur. (Not that this Twitter deal is proceeding normally though!) There’s still some speculation that Musk is looking to fully back out and will find a way to do so, billion-dollar breakup fee notwithstanding. In the meantime, the bankers are still preparing the paperwork and execs are still leaving. This week, it was Twitter Service VP Katrina Lane, head of data science Max Schmeiser and VP of product management Ilya Brown — all of whom chose to leave on their own.
Apple’s new rules let apps raise subscription prices automatically
Image Credits: TechCrunch
Alongside the launch of the iOS 15.5 update, Apple introduced a new set of rules to govern auto-renewing subscriptions on the App Store. Now, instead of asking users to agree to any subscription price increases, developers will be able to roll out a price increase with the user’s explicit consent. The feature allows developers to simply inform customers they’ll be charged more, but not require the customer to opt-in to the higher pricing.
We first broke the news that Apple was pilot testing this program last month, when it appeared Disney+ subscription customers had simply been told their price was increasing but weren’t asked for their consent. Apple then confirmed this was the result of a “new commerce feature” it planned to launch soon, which it said would be “great for both developers and users.”
Apple’s position is that this could save customers the hassle of having their subscriptions automatically canceled just because they didn’t see the notification or email that asked them to opt in to the price increase.
“This has led to some services being unintentionally interrupted for users and they must take steps to resubscribe within the app, from Settings on iPhone and iPad, or in the App Store on Mac,” the company explained in its announcement on Monday.
However, the flip side of this argument is that those same customers who would have missed the consent notification will likely be the same ones who would now miss the notification informing them their subscription will be increasing in price. There’s also an argument here that this change could enable unscrupulous developers and scammers to better profit from their victims if Apple doesn’t carefully enforce the program rules.
Currently, those state that developers can’t increase prices more than once per year. The increase also can’t exceed 50% of the subscription price, and the difference in price can’t exceed $5 USD per period for non-annual subscriptions or $50 USD for annual subscriptions.
Weekly News
Platforms: Apple

Apple released the first public betas of iOS 15.6, iPadOS 15.6, tvOS 15.6, watchOS 8.7 and macOS 12.5. Now included in the beta lineup is HomePod Software 15.6.
Apple also released iOS 15.5 to the public, which included a new way to request and send money from their Apple Cash card through the Wallet app, as well as a slew of new features for the Apple Podcasts app, and other features.
The latest Swift Playgrounds update (ver. 4.1) added App Store Connect integration for macOS users.
Apple targeted data brokers in its latest ad that promotes iOS privacy features.


Platforms: Google

Google Play expanded its app sanctions against Russia to include Belarus. The company will block the download of paid apps and updates to paid apps in both Russia and Belarus, it said in an update to its help article on the matter.
Alongside its announcement of its new Fire 7 tablet, Amazon also revealed that its upcoming Fire OS 8, its own Android-based OS, will launch in June.
An update to the Google System Update changelog again indicates that Google’s Family Link software will allow parents to set a persistent launcher on their child’s supervised device. This would make it so that a child couldn’t change the phone’s launcher to do anything other than what’s approved. The feature hasn’t been publicly announced.

E-commerce and Food Delivery

Uber announced a partnership with Grocery Outlet to pilot on-demand and scheduled grocery delivery. Initially, users can shop at 72 Grocery Outlet stores in California, Oregon and Washington state via the Uber or Uber Eats app.
Uber also announced a whole host of new features at its global product event earlier in the week. Here, Uber launched an “Uber Travel” feature that helps riders pre-book rides to and from upcoming events, like flights or restaurant reservations. It also announced an Uber Charter service for booking party buses, passenger vans and coach buses; plus event vouchers, an EV and charging map, various new Uber Eats products and additional perks for its Uber One membership; and more.
Snapchat and eBay announce integrations. Snapchat users can now share eBay listings with their friends using the Snapchat Camera on Android and iOS.
YouTube teased new features that it claims will make it easier for viewers to discover and buy from brands. One new feature will allow two creators to go live at the same time to co-host a single live shopping stream. This could effectively double the draw for the event, as each creator would bring their own fanbase to the stream. Another upcoming option is called “live redirects.” With this, creators are able to start a shopping livestream on their channel, then redirect their audience over to a brand’s channel for fans to keep watching. This allows brands to tap into the power of the creator’s platform and reach their fanbase, but then gives the brands themselves access to that audience — and the key metrics and analytics associated with their live event — directly on their own YouTube channel.

Fintech

FTX US plans to launch FTX Stocks, a zero-commission stock trading feature available through the FTX mobile app, rolling out in the U.S. in the “coming months.” The news is particularly notable given that billionaire FTX US founder Sam Bankman-Fried recently acquired a 7.6% stake in Robinhood.
Robinhood will launch a standalone app that lets users hold their own cryptocurrencies and NFTs, putting it in direct competition with Coinbase and startups like MetaMask or Rainbow. The move comes at a time when Robinhood’s stocks are off by more than 70% since its IPO.
Coinbase backtracked on its hiring plans, citing the crypto market turmoil. The company had earlier planned to triple headcount this year, but is now reassessing its headcount needs.
Coinbase also said it would let a “small set” of users access Ethereum-based decentralized apps directly from its own app via the new dApp browser. The feature would allow users to purchase NFTs on OpenSea and Coinbase’s NFT platform; trade on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and SushiSwap; and borrow and lend through DeFi platforms like Curve and Compound.
Plaid, whose service powers a number of fintech aps, announced two products for ACH transfers, including identity verification, putting it into competition with Stripe.
Greenlight, a $2.3 billion fintech focused on kids, launched a credit card for parents. The Greenlight-branded card, offered through Mastercard, offers up to 3% unlimited cash back on all purchases and gives parents the option to automatically invest those cash rewards in stocks and ETFs. They also can choose to invest the cash in other ways through the Greenlight mobile app or transfer funds to their bank.

Social

TikTok launched Branded Mission, a new ad product that lets advertisers crowdsource content from creators with at least 1,000 followers. Advertisers can launch branded campaigns by developing a brief and releasing it to the creator community, encouraging them to participate in Branded Missions. Eligible creators whose videos are selected by brands will then benefit from a cash payment and boosted traffic.
TikTok launched its first creator crediting tool to help video creators cite their inspiration for dances, jokes, sounds and other content. The tool allows a creator to pick a video that’s then automatically added to their own video’s caption, linking back to the original creator. The changes follow years of complaints that top TikTok stars were lifting choreography from smaller creators, often Black creators. The problem got so bad that last year, some Black creators went on strike, refusing to create new dance moves for a recently dropped Megan Thee Stallion single as a form of protest.

Twitter rolled out the ability for creators to host Super Follows-only Spaces as a subscriber perk. Subscribers globally on iOS and Android will be able to join and request to speak in Super Follows-only Spaces. (Web users can only join and listen for now.) Users who aren’t Super Following a creator can still see the Space but won’t be able to access it unless they subscribe.
Snap announced its new Snap Originals shows, which were also recently previewed at a company event. The show features stars like Simone Biles, winner of 32 Olympic and World Championship medals; NAACP Image Award winner La’Ron Hines; Dixie and Charli D’Amelio; and others.
Facebook and Twitter struggled to contain the Buffalo shooting video which was circulating across their platforms where it was being reported by end users. The New York AG also announced plans to investigate Twitch, Discord and 4chan for their role in the mass shooting.
Snap-owned social maps app Zenly, used by 35 million people monthly, rolled out its own mapping data and engine following last month’s redesign. The project was built using open source data from OpenStreetMap and acquired datasets from third parties. The maps feature 3D landmarks, animated effects, tiny cars, people, 3D trees and more. The new maps are live in Taipei, Tokyo, Paris, Los Angeles, New York and Seoul.

Photos

Photo and video-editing app Picsart laid off 90 employees, or around 8% of its workforce, amid the market downturn.

Dating

Regulatory filings indicated Tiger Global sold off its entire stake in Bumble, along with other apps like Airbnb and Didi, as well as ~80% of its stake in Robinhood during 2022’s tech stock sell-off, FT reported.
Match Group-owned Hinge introduced a new feature aimed at helping users initiate conversations about self-care. The new Self-Care Prompts may include things like “The last time I cried happy tears was…,” “My friends ask me for advice about…,” “To me, relaxation is…,” “I feel most supported when…,” “A boundary of mine is…,” and others.

Messaging

Meta launched its free WhatsApp Cloud API, aimed at SMBs, to all businesses worldwide after earlier beta testing. The API allows companies to build on top of WhatsApp to better serve their customers, but without the costs and longer integration time for the on-premise version. WhatsApp also said it would roll out paid features for its WhatsApp Business app later this year, including things like the ability to manage chats across up to 10 devices. The company will also provide new customizable WhatsApp click-to-chat links that help businesses attract customers across their online presence, it said.
WhatsApp is also developing a feature that will allow users to stealthily exit group chats without informing the group, according to a leak from WABetaInfo. The feature was developed for the new Communities feature rolling out slowly this year.
Indian users of the Google Messages app say RCS is being abused by businesses to spam users with ads, with the frequency of the ads picking up over the past few months.
Apple’s Communication Safety in Messages expanded to more countries with iOS 15.5, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K.

Streaming & Entertainment

YouTube’s player gained new features, including Most Replayed, Video Chapters for big-screen devices, Single Loop and more. The company said it’s adding a graph that people can use to easily locate and watch the most replayed parts of a video — something that could be particularly helpful for longer videos or those that haven’t broken down their various sections using either timestamps or video chapters. It also rolled out Video Chapters to smart TVs and gaming consoles and an option to set a video on a looping mode.
Apple Music launched Apple Music Live, a new recurring series that will livestream concerts from major artists, kicking off with a Harry Styles concert Friday at 9 PM ET alongside the release of his third album, “Harry’s House.” Encore streams will run at 12:00 PM ET on  May 22 and 5 AM ET on May 26. Apple wouldn’t say if VOD streams would ever be available.
Spotify and Accenture teamed up in order to offer Spotify Premium as an employee perk as part of a new offering called “Spotify for Work.” Accenture kicked off the deal by rolling out Spotify to its employees across Sweden, Latvia and Lithuania.
YouTube Music for Wear OS was updated to allow users to stream content over Wi-Fi and LTE. The feature means users will be able to listen to favorite songs even if their phone isn’t nearby.
Charli XCX is scheduled to play a “metaverse” concert on Roblox on June 17, 2022, at 7 PM ET. The concert will follow a five-week virtual event comprising mini-games and other digital challenges.
The Apple Podcasts app gained new storage clean-up tools, support for annual subscriptions and a new distribution system. The new Apple Podcasts Delegated Delivery system will soon allow creators to more easily distribute their podcasts directly to Apple Podcasts from third-party hosting providers, including Acast, ART19, Blubrry, Buzzsprout, Libsyn, Omny Studio and RSS.com. The clean-up tools, meanwhile, will come in handy for better controlling how many episodes are saved locally and give you a chance to bulk remove downloads for the first time, including on Mac.

Gaming

Fortnite launched to all iOS users via Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service after a few months of closed beta trials. The launch means iPhone users have yet another workaround to play the popular game on their device, despite its ban from the App Store, following Fortnite’s launch on Microsoft’s Cloud Gaming service earlier this month.
A report from Reuters said TikTok was testing HTML5 games in Vietnam, but TikTok told TechCrunch that was inaccurate — no games were currently testing in that market. However, the company had previously confirmed it was engaged in further gaming partnership discussions after its Zynga deal was announced.
TechCrunch also reported and confirmed a separate effort focused on bringing interactive minigames — like “Draw & Guess” — to the TikTok LIVE platform.
Niantic’s Pokémon GO partnered with Amazon Prime Gaming and Prime Student to offer exclusive bonus item bundles every two weeks to Prime members. Users can log in to Prime and get a code, which they can redeem on Niantic’s rewards page. The items will then appear in the game.

Security & Privacy

Brave’s iOS web browser was updated with a new Privacy Hub feature that offers users more visibility on exactly what Brave blocked, and how Brave protects your personal information online. It does so by showing a rolling update of how many trackers Brave blocked on a specific site, or in a given time span. The hub also offers education about trackers and privacy threats.
Apple patched almost 30 security flaws with iOS 15.5, as well as over 50 fixes for macOS 12.4.

Funding and M&A
💰 Pintarnya, a startup building a super app for Indonesia’s blue-collar workers, raised $6.3 million in seed funding led by Sequoia Capital India and General Catalyst. The funding includes a $100,000 grant from Sequoia Spark, a program for women founders. The app offers verified job postings and financial services, like loans, for blue-collar workers.
💰 Instant delivery app Gopuff, valued at $15 billion, announced a new advisor and investor: Bob Iger, the former CEO and chairman of The Walt Disney Company.

💰 Instabug, a startup that helps mobile developers monitor, identify and fix bugs within apps, raised $46 million in Series B funding led by Insight Partners. The company said its ARR doubled in 2021 and the number of enterprise customers grew 10x, as it added new clients like DoorDash, Verizon, Qualtrics, Porsche and Gojek. Last year, its software sat within 2.7 billion mobile devices, processed 110 billion mobile sessions (up at least 20x from 2020) and helped customers resolve 4.2 billion issues, it said.
💰 Unit, a banking-as-a-service startup that allows developers to easily build new fintech apps, raised $100 million in Series C funding led by Insight Partners, at a $1.2 billion valuation. Unit said its transaction volume grew 7x over the past six months and has crossed an annualized transaction volume of $2.6 billion. It’s also issued over 430,000 cards to over 330,000 customers and saw a 10x increase in deposit volumes.

"Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft has had a rough couple years, but this afternoon it successfully docked with the International Space Station, its first successful mission to orbit. Despite a few hiccups, this launch went more or less as planned, and if the craft can return to Earth safely that will make this a huge accomplishment for the beleaguered aerospace company.
Without recapping all the troubles the Starliner has had, let it suffice to say that delays upon delays led some to question whether this capsule would ever make it to orbit, to say nothing of making regular trips with crew aboard.
But naysayers may have to hold their tongues, at least for a week or two, after the Starliner’s successful launch and orbital insertion yesterday. and what appeared to be a textbook docking procedure this afternoon. Check out this great shot of the capsule during its “inbound flyaround”:


The @BoeingSpace #Starliner fires its engines to begin its flyaround of the station for a 7:10pm ET docking today. https://t.co/yuOTrZ4Jut pic.twitter.com/hKXgYU2fgQ

That’s not to say there were no problems whatsoever. Two orbital maneuvering and attitude control (OMAC) thrusters, which are exactly as important as they sound, had to be shut off during the insertion burn due to “a chamber drop in pressure.” There is also “off-nominal behavior of a thermal cooling loop.”
Naturally there are redundancies and tolerances in place for these kinds of things, and the Starliner continued on its merry way. But a multiple thruster failure isn’t something you can shrug off as “space is hard.” This was neither the first time the craft has been in space, nor its first time having thrust problems.
You better believe NASA, which has paid Boeing handsomely to develop this equipment, is going to be looking at this event through an electron microscope before committing another dime to the program.
Nevertheless, the spacecraft did complete its official orbital mission — a first for the Starliner — and a huge amount of things have to go right for that to happen. That’s definitely a win for Boeing, and they really needed one of those.
Plus they got this really awesome view, which looks fake but is definitely real:

"On the Chain Reaction podcast this week, we dove into a topic that tends to stir up strong emotions, even from those outside the crypto space — the metaverse. Mercedes Bent, an investor at Lightspeed Venture Partners who focuses on consumer investments in crypto, joined us to unpack this loaded term and explain why she sees its potential.
“It’s become like a punching bag,” Bent told TechCrunch. “If you think about the potential of it, and why maybe a geek like me gets excited about it, it’s because there are things you can do [in the metaverse] that you could not do in the real world.”

The prospect of attending an event with tens of thousands of other attendees across the world in the metaverse, for example, excites Bent. But even more than entertainment, Bent is enthusiastic about the potential for the metaverse to have an impact through education. She shared the hypothetical example of public school students being able to learn from the best instructors in the world in a metaverse similar to the movie “Ready Player One” — though without the dystopian elements, she qualified. Bent’s vision squares up with some of her non-crypto consumer investments at Lightspeed, such as small-group live education platform Outschool.
But what will the metaverse actually look like? When we asked Bent, who once worked for virtual reality technology company Upload, she said she used to think the metaverse had to be tied to VR technology, specifically the head-mounted display screen.
She’s since realized that what the metaverse has to offer has less to do with how users access it physically and more to do with the sense of community it can foster.
“I think what this era — the 2021 and 2022 era of the metaverse terminology — has shown is that it’s not about the headset, it’s not about what physical apparatus you use, it’s about the sense of [a] collective being together, and presence,” she added.
While VR tech itself has been around for decades, Bent posits that the metaverse gained traction as a concept last year because it offered one thing classic VR games like Second Life did not — the ability to transfer in-game currency to fiat currency. Cryptocurrency, she believes, made that switch possible.
“There was obviously in-game currency and there were obviously virtual goods you could buy before, but the ability to be able to transfer that to fiat and then go use it in the real world to pay your rent bill is just something entirely different that we didn’t have in such a mass quantity before,” Bent said.
That technological development coupled with the onset of the pandemic, which gave people the opportunity to spend more time online, gave the metaverse new life, she continued.
Skeptics think the metaverse gets a lot of hype and isn’t backed by substantial technology or user adoption. Bent said that in her experience, skepticism is to be expected for any early-stage consumer products.
“These hyped areas look really non-obvious. I mean, they don’t have traction; they’re just an idea. They’re often from a founder who hasn’t necessarily had the most pedigree, so you have to kind of take a leap of faith,” Bent said. Bent’s mission as an investor is to back “early-stage consumer companies that are unlocking wealth creation for underserved individuals and regions,” according to her website — a thesis that might help explain where she finds some of that faith.
As an early-stage consumer investor, Bent pushes back on the idea that it’s too early to fund consumer-facing crypto companies that haven’t yet honed their user experience.
“There are not very many companies [in web3] that I would say have scaled to what I would call a mass audience yet. We have Metamask, which is pretty far along, but I think all of these companies are up for grabs in terms of [whether] somebody else could come along to replace them,” Bent said. “I think we’re going to see the next WhatsApp, AOL and Google founded in short order.”

"Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh, human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.
“You can often pick up significant market share in an economic downturn by just staying alive,” top startup accelerator Y Combinator wrote in an internal e-mail to its founders this week. The advice was one of ten bullet points in a memo meant to help companies navigate the economic downturn crushing tech. Other stand-out quotes include “plan for the worst” and “no one can predict how bad the economy will get, but things don’t look good.”
The email is a vibe shift from just a few weeks ago, when hundreds of Y Combinator startups — many of which already raised venture funding — presented themselves to the public on Demo Day. The startups were the first to receive Y Combinator’s new $500,000 standard check and were aggressively focused on international opportunity. Now, YC is saying that “this slow down will have a disproportionate impact on international companies,” among others.

YC advises founders to ‘plan for the worst’ amid market teardown

While Y Combinator’s memo wasn’t meant to be public, it isn’t the only one publishing a Black Swan Memo in preparation for what’s to come. TechCrunch obtained a series of memos that venture capitalist firms sent to portfolio companies about the market downturn. Some were hopeful, some were simple, and others were a vibe check as straightforward as, Can you tell us your ARR and cash-burn in writing? Pretty please?
I explored this topic in my most recent TechCrunch+ column, “It’s not business as usual (and investors are admitting it).” Subscribe to Equity for a podcast version of this conversation next week as well! In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll address more layoffs at tech companies, ghosts showing up to $44 billion dates, and Swyft startups. As always, you can support me by forwarding this newsletter to a friend or following me on Twitter or my blog.
So. Many. Layoffs. 
May’s mad month of layoffs continues. Amanda and I wrote up a third installment of tech layoffs that rippled across all industries and stages. Employees from Section4, Carvana, DataRobot, Mural, Robinhood, On Deck, Thrasio, MainStreet and Netflix have been impacted by the workforce reductions. Some bigger companies are instituting hiring freezes, such as Twitter and Meta, or announcing a shift in strategy, such as Uber.
Here’s why it’s important: At time of publication, employees from Picsart, Netflix, Cars24 and Skillz were impacted by this week’s wave of reductions. It tells us who is vulnerable from a business model perspective — such as subscription-based businesses and marketplaces — and that companies may start to conduct more than one round of layoffs in the same month (cough, cough, Netflix).

On Equity this week, your favorite podcast trio spoke about unicorn vibes, property ownership tech plays and, as you can tell by the headline, the latest in the Elon Musk Twitter story. At this point, we’re deciding if it’s even worth trying to keep track of the timeline.
Here’s why it’s important: Our weekly digest of tech news is a good way to track the big news items that shape this wonky landscape, and stay aware of deals that may have flown under your radar. In this case, we spent the biggest chunk of time deciding why Elon Musk is ghosting the $44 billion date that he made with Twitter. The answer, not so complicatedly, seems because he’s more interested in chasing than cuffing.
After we recorded our episode, more news about Elon Musk emerged from an investigation by Business Insider. Allegedly, Elon Musk exposed himself to a SpaceX flight attendant and propositioned her for sex. The company paid $250,000 for her silence, Business Insider reports. Musk has since denied the harassment claims. Read the entire story here.

Deal of the week
Swyft Cities! The Mountain View–based company, built by Google alums, wants to improve transportation and offer a lower-cost-per-mile vehicle with a smaller carbon emission footprint. The solution looks like an autonomous, lightweight, fixed-cable vehicle. The startup is the winner of the TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility 2022 pitch-off, with Beyond Aero as the runner-up.
Here’s why it’s important: Swyft has checked off a lot of ‘we’re not flailing” boxes. Alongside a MVP and debut customer agreement, the company set up a R&D center in Christchurch, New Zealand. It also works with Remarkables Park in Queenstown, a large office, retail and residential space, to develop a network of autonomous gondolas, TechCrunch reports. It plans to be up and running by August 2024.

"Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the daily TechCrunch+ column where it gets its name. Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here.
Deep tech has become a hot topic in Europe, with hopes that the region can have an edge over the rest of the world for innovation rooted in fundamental research. One of the key arguments: European countries have great universities and talent. But how can academic talent translate into startups? Let’s dive in. — Anna
Universities, a deep tech cauldron
“From startups to universities, we join forces to make Europe a world leader in the new wave of deep tech innovation!” European commissioner Mariya Gabriel tweeted earlier this week after her talk at the Tech.eu Summit in Brussels. As I noticed while attending the event, she was far from the only one to mention this topic enthusiastically.
That deep tech raises high hopes in Europe wasn’t exactly a surprise. Alex and I already wrote about Europe’s deep tech boom and investor interest in it earlier this year. But the role that educational institutions are expected to play piqued my interest.

VCs weigh in on Europe’s future in the critical deep tech market

“There is no doubt that the future of innovation in Europe will emerge from its world-leading universities,” Riam Kanso wrote in a Tech.eu guest post ahead of the event. Kanso is the founder of Conception X, which I had coincidentally heard about for the first time earlier this month. The U.K.-based nonprofit aims to transform Ph.D. researchers into venture scientists.
“It’s a simple but well-proven recipe,” Kanso said. “You have a Ph.D. team working on cutting-edge research with key real-world applications. They know their innovation could help discover effective treatments for now-incurable diseases, power up carbon-negative cities or tackle the future of automation. Through a combination of entrepreneurship training, access to pro-bono legal advice, funding opportunities and expert connections, we help them figure out how to turn their research into a viable deep tech startup.”
It isn’t a new thing for universities to more or less willingly give birth to spinoffs or spinouts (we will use the terms interchangeably here.) MIT, for instance, is famous for counting many entrepreneurs among its alumni, and quite a few of these ventures are based on intellectual property developed during their studies or research.
But in Europe, intellectual property can be a thorny issue. The “potential for meaningful innovation brewing across Europe’s research labs,” Kanso said, “largely remains untapped due to varying — and at times stifling — IP ownership rules that can make spinout companies uninvestable and hard to scale.”
Increasingly though, both European universities and venture capital firms are making efforts to make sure the most promising seeds turn into successful companies.
Mind the gap
Despite the hurdles, VCs looking for innovation know that spinouts are very much worth their attention. “As an investor in early-stage businesses, many with a deeply technical nature, we see universities as foundational to the companies we invest in,” said Simon King, himself a VC with a Ph.D.",,"https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/,https://techcrunch.com/newsletters,https://twitter.com/abracarioca,https://twitter.com/gabrielmariya/status/1526526944778518535,https://twitter.com/alex,https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/17/why-you-shouldnt-ignore-europes-deep-tech-boom/,https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/24/vcs-weigh-in-on-europes-future-in-the-critical-deep-tech-market/,https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/24/vcs-weigh-in-on-europes-future-in-the-critical-deep-tech-market/,https://tech.eu/2022/04/13/how-training-phd-students-in-deeptech-entrepreneurship-can-spur-european-innovation,https://conceptionx.org/,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/03/deal-flow-newsletter-preseed-now-to-introduce-future-uk-crown-jewels-to-investors/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_founded_by_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_alumni,https://sifted.eu/articles/university-tech-transfer-overhaul/",2022-05-21T17:01:53,Europe&#8217;s deep tech depends on university spinouts
"Hi all!
Welcome back to Week in Review, our newsletter where we wrap up many of the top stories to hit TechCrunch over the last seven days.
The big thing this week, based on what people were reading most, were the details of a memo sent from Y Combinator to its portfolio founders.
As the markets continue to slide,YC is telling its portfolio founders that it’s time to batten down the hatches — cut costs, extend runway and get to a “default alive” state. “For those of you who have started your company within the last 5 years,” YC writes, “question what you believe to be the normal fundraising environment.”

"Recent product news from Stripe and Plaid indicate the two private companies are gunning for one another as the market for B2B financial technology matures, expands and individual players increasingly overlap.
It might sound silly that Stripe, best known for its payments technology, and Plaid, best known for its API that connects consumer bank accounts to third-party services, are competing. It isn’t.
The quote, “All software tastes like chicken from a financial perspective” is both funny and true. It’s also largely true for fintech companies, but for a reason unique to the space: Fintech startups, unicorns and even public companies tend to broaden their capabilities over time, adding more and more competencies.
Both B2B and B2C startups have similar motives. Customer acquisition (advertising, onboarding, etc.) is expensive and competitive, so once a fintech lands a user or customer, it’s best to extract as much value from them as possible. That’s why companies like Plaid and Stripe build and buy to serve more and more of their customers’ needs — until they wind up at each other’s doorstep.
What happens once they do? We’re going to find out.
Recent skirmishes from the Great Fintech War
In January 2022, Plaid announced that it was buying Cognito, a decision that TechCrunch wrote was part of a move “beyond merely connecting accounts.” In essence, Cognito added know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-fraud tools to Plaid’s feature list. By doing so, it could offer its customers far more than just account connections.
In 2021, Plaid had bought a company called Flannel that focused on payments. With account connections, security tooling and payments tech, Plaid was building and buying its way into a larger potential total addressable market — one that’s already being attacked by other private fintechs.
It’s obvious that Stripe has broadened its feature set away from its original remit. The company has so many services that its on-site menus are becoming more of a catalog than an organizational tool. Seeing the company launching something new here and there, then, is nothing out of the ordinary.
But in early May, when Stripe announced “Financial Connections,” a service that will, TechCrunch wrote, let its “customers connect directly to their customers’ bank accounts to access financial data to speed up or run certain kinds of transactions,” we took note.
The product announcement put Stripe on a collision course with Plaid’s core business, even if it was fair play — the latter company had already told the market that payments were on its mind through the 2021 Flannel deal.
Still, Plaid clearly took exception with what its leaders implied was a sneaky means of acquiring information and a lack of transparency on Stripe’s part in light of their partnership and history.
With the two companies fussing at one another on Twitter, it was clear that the gloves, as much as they can be in the API world, were off.

"The inevitable physics of economics is upon us — what goes up must come down — and we appear to be headed for the down part of the equation.
But all is not lost. If you need a reminder, Venmo, Instagram, Uber and WhatsApp all launched during the Great Recession of 2008.
When I think about recessions, I remember what an electrician said while working on my house during the dot-com blowup. I’d asked him if he was worried about the economy affecting his work, and as he drilled another hole for the wiring, he looked up at me and said, “Nah. A bad economy just weeds out the hacks.”
If your company is lacking basic business fundamentals and burning cash, well, maybe you’re in for a reckoning. But then again, maybe you always were. But if you have a well-grounded startup built on a good idea with a solid foundation, you can probably ride out whatever storm is coming.
The question is this: Are you building something essential at the core of your customer’s business, which Operator Collective founder and CEO Mallun Yen refers to as painkillers? Or are you building something less essential, which she calls vitamins?
Painkillers versus vitamins
“Companies building painkillers rather than vitamins, especially solutions that are technically hard or tricky to develop, or anticipate fundamental but yet-to-be-mainstream shifts in an industry, are particularly well positioned to weather the macro conditions that are out of their control. Painkillers include products that increase revenue or significantly lower costs in a tangible way,” Yen told me.
She said those startups can be in any category as long as they are helping companies work smarter, which is even more essential in an uncertain economy.
“For instance, we have one company we are investing in that enables customers to significantly increase their sales by enabling them to do things in a way that hasn’t been done before. Another is materially lowering cloud infrastructure spend — a pain point that will only increase for companies across the board as more data is stored in the cloud and corresponding queries and other analysis need to be run.”
Derek Zanutto, general partner at CapitalG, said that while many companies will experience some short-term hiccups due to market fluctuations, his firm still expects to see many grow and thrive over the coming years.
“Some of the greatest companies have been founded or emerged stronger than ever during weakened market conditions. I’m particularly bullish on startups that are helping enterprises harness the power of their data. Data, when leveraged well, can help enterprises both rein in costs and generate more money, making it, over the long term, a recession-proof business sector,” Zanutto said.
Soma Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures, said his firm has been investing in intelligent applications, adding that regardless of what’s happening in the macro environment, they are sticking to the plan.

"Since its launch in December, StepN, an app that lets users walk and run to earn tokens, has quickly become a household name in the play-to-earn blockchain gaming, or GameFi, world. Two to three million users worldwide are now active on the app every month, StepN’s co-founder Jerry Huang recently told TechCrunch.
That number is nowhere close to the hundred-million player size enjoyed by popular web2 titles, but in the world of crypto, it’s a meaningful breakthrough for a five-month-old app. As of May 22, the market cap of StepN’s native token GMT stood at around $860 million.
Founded by Huang and his co-founder Yawn Rong in Adelaide, Australia, StepN debuted at a Solana hackathon in October. After coming in fourth, its exposure at the event helped land its first batch of beta users. When it officially launched two months later, words about the app that let one earn by staying fit had already spread within the blockchain community. Without any splashy ad campaign, scores of users signed up.
In weeks, StepN was growing so fast that the team needed to cap the number of daily registrations. Now, tens of thousands of new users are joining the app per day, according to Huang.
Huang, a serial entrepreneur, and Rong, a blockchain venture capitalist, were self-funding the project at first for the pair were “financially stable.” But in September, they decided that fundraising could bring in other meaningful resources such as partnerships and publicity. The founders spoke to over 100 investors and revised their pitch deck over 40 times before closing a $5 million seed round from Sequoia Capital and others in November.
“We didn’t have a product at the time, and many investors couldn’t understand what we were doing. Sequoia did. The process of addressing investor questions also helped us refine the product to where it was later,” said Huang.
Indeed, the fast-growing app appears to be self-sustainable for now. It’s generating $3-5 million in net profit from trading fees a day, and earning up to $100 million every month. In April, it picked up another round of strategic investment from Binance.
Is it a game?
Some argue what makes StepN — and other play-to-earn blockchain games like Axie Infinity — successful is the fact that they are essentially financial products with a gamified twist.
To start earning tokens and logging one’s mileage on StepN, users need to first spend at least 12 sol or around $600 on a pair of virtual shoes at the current market rate. The digital shoes are in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) that runs on the Solana network and Binance’s smart chain so can be resold later, but the entry fee is still not a trivial amount for any casual player.
Over time, StepN users will need to accumulate new kicks to level up. The usual return on investment requires about a month, upon which people can start generating income of up to several thousand dollars per day depending on their level, activeness, and the current price of StepN tokens. In other words, the game can be quite lucrative.
In the eyes of some gaming veterans, the gameplay of most existing GameFi apps is “easy and mindless.” Axie Infinity, for instance, features cute blob-like creatures that fight in simple battles. As such, web2 gaming incumbents are entering GameFi in droves, pledging to bring quality back to the industry.
Huang begged to differ. “A lot of the triple-A games overemphasize aesthetics and big budgets, but they aren’t really that innovative when it comes to gameplay, whereas some simple-looking games like Plants vs. Zombies come with brilliant gameplay that makes them last,” said Huang, who ran his own gaming studio in China before moving to Australia a decade ago.
“Many newcomers to GameFi are blindly pursuing triple-A productions,” he continued. “But if they weren’t already successful in web2, why would they be in web3? Some simple-looking games aren’t that simple behind the scene, for instance, how we design the economics of our app.”
Is it sustainable?
Other critics question the financial sustainability of play-to-earn. Maintaining such a business model means the gameplay needs to be either so addictive that users continue to play without cashing out their coins, or that the app continues to attract new users who buy in only to replace those who cash out. Critics have even drawn parallels between play-to-earn to pyramid schemes.
Axie Infinity hasn’t been able to sustain its meteoric rise. Sky Mavis, the Vietnamese gaming studio behind the game, was valued at $3 billion in a $150 million financing round last October. But its token has lost over 80% of its value since peaking in November at $160, and its sales volume has nosedived from $754 million to just $5 million.
Losing a few thousand dollars isn’t the end of the world for most of StepN’s users, who are 20-40 year-olds from affluent countries like the US, Japan, and Europe. China, where crypto trading is banned, accounts for less than 5% of its user base, Huang said. But Axie Infinity’s players are concentrated in developing countries like the Philippines and Venezuela, many of whom are betting a significant amount of their savings on the game, a major source of their income during the COVID pandemic.
StepN proposes a two-fold solution to sustainability. For one, it’s working on a price stabilization mechanism to ensure the cost of its coins is always at a rate that the shoes are affordable for new users but also not so cheap that existing users lack the incentives to mint new shoes, that is, create new shoes on the blockchain and sell.
Price manipulation is achieved through its dual-token system. When the price of its “utility coin” GST is too high and shoes get pricey, StepN will ask players to burn its “governance coin” GMT to mint new shoes. The supply of GST increases as a result, leading to a sell-off and bringing its cost down.
Huang also argued StepN’s fitness component makes it fundamentally different from Axie Infinity. “Yes, users can make money from StepN in the early stage, but over time they will also grow accustomed to staying active, so they will continue to walk or run regardless of financial rewards.”
“Many people don’t see StepN as a real game. Nor do they consider it a running app because users can make money from it,” said Curt Shi, founding partner at Welinder & Shi Capital and an early investor in StepN. “It’s hard to define what it is right now, but time will tell.”
Killer app?
Huang’s other defense is the role StepN could play in evangelizing blockchain to the world. An estimate of 30% of the app’s users has never used any blockchain services before.
“Many people might have used centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase to trade, but few know what a DEX [decentralized exchange] is, nor have they traded NFTs on a marketplace or owned a self-custodial wallet. We have the potential to onboard tens of millions of web3 users and I think this is something very meaningful.”
“I think people are paying too much attention to the [sustainability] issue,” the founder continued. “ROI might slow over time, but all games have life cycles. You also need to look at what value an app creates.”
Momentum might slow down sooner than expected for the app amid crashing crypto values. Venture capital firms are warning startups to brace for a “crypto winter” and industry giants like Coinbase are applying the brakes on hiring. As consumers lose confidence in the market and become less willing to spend on tokens or NFTs, blockchain apps that rely on attracting new users to drive up their economies might face more roadblocks.
But Huang finds a silver lining in the current downturn. “There was a lot of froth in the market. Now the bubble is bursting, our shoes will become more affordable, and only the [blockchain] apps with real use case will survive.”
“The market was clearly frothy, so it’s a good thing that [StepN’s market cap] has shrunk over the past few days,” said Shi. “To maintain an ultra-high market cap can be stressful for the team, and now the team will be focusing more on the product itself and we believe StepN will outperform in bear and will be a winner in the next bull market.”
Operating with a rapidly expanding team of 70 people across countries including Australia, the UK, the US and Singapore, StepN’s next step is to build a social product around its token holder community, the challenge now is to prove that it can continue to draw in a constant stream new runners.

"Welcome back to The Interchange, the weekly TechCrunch series that looks at the latest — and what’s ahead — in the global fintech industry. It’s an incredible time to be a financial technology journalist. Besides the fact that over 20% of all venture dollars last year went into fintech startups, I am particularly excited about the myriad ways that this technology is helping boost inclusion all over the world. While the pandemic sucked on 1,000 different levels, one silver lining is that consumers and businesses have forced more fintech to exist, and that’s a good thing.

The state of venture
Reporting on startups and the venture world at a time like this is a series of contradictions. One day, we’re reading about investment giants like Tiger Global seeing about $17 billion in losses. Then the next, I open my inbox to see pitches for nine-figure funding rounds (hello, SpotOn) and the birth of new unicorns (looking at you, Unit).
One day, I’m hearing personal accounts of VCs pulling term sheets at the last minute, with some citing that their own investors had backed out of providing funds, leaving founders scrambling to save a round — and face. Then the next, I have a founder telling me their latest round was preempted by a large venture firm in their industry.
One day, I’m having a fintech-focused VC tell me they haven’t invested in any startups since last October. The next, I’m having PayPal Venture alums share news of the closure of a new $158 million fund, ready to back about two dozen early-stage startups through their new firm, Infinity Ventures.
One day, Y Combinator is advising its portfolio founders to “plan for the worst” as startups across the globe scramble to navigate a sharp reversal after a 13-year bull run. The next, Lightspeed Venture Partners is urging founders to “stay optimistic.”
The myriad conflicting signals are enough to make anyone’s head spin, but as journalists, we have to take it all in stride. I’ve come to realize, in reporting on startups and venture capital pretty much exclusively for the past 5 years — and for many more before that in one capacity or another — that nothing is black and white, things aren’t always what they seem and they can change in the blink of an eye. For example, that fund I referred to? It actually closed last October.
During the late ’90s dot.com boom, I remember marveling at the ridiculous amounts of cash being thrown around to startups for sometimes ridiculous ideas. Not gonna lie, there was a similar vibe in 2021, where companies with no revenue, no customers and in some cases, no revenue model even, were landing millions of dollars in funding. It caused me serious anxiety to even open my inbox because the sheer number of pitches was so overwhelming and there were so many startups doing so many similar things, that it got harder and harder to tell them apart.
Here we are today. I have a (slightly) quieter inbox, VCs appear to be applying more (or in some cases, some when there was little to none) due diligence and valuations are either flat or only inching upward rather than soaring — even dropping in some cases. Layoffs abound, just months after headlines of a tech worker shortage in the midst of hiring frenzies. Meanwhile, startups are being held to higher standards when it comes to revenue, customers and profitability. There’s a panic in the air that wasn’t there before as everyone wonders what’s next for founders, investors and startups as a whole.
Is this a market correction or just a shift to the way things should be? Maybe a little of both. Either way, I do think fintech continues to be somewhat of an outlier, at least for now.

Weekly News
The drama between Plaid and Stripe continued this week with the former announcing an expansion outside its core offering of account linking for the first time since its 2013 inception. The news that Plaid is moving into identity and income verification, fraud prevention and account funding was not entirely shocking considering that the startup had made a couple of acquisitions in the past 18 months. It was largely in demand, according to CEO and co-founder Zach Perret, from customers and a desire on its part to “own more of the account funding process.” And it puts Plaid into even more of a competitive position with payments giant Stripe.
Meanwhile, Stripe had news of its own, taking the wraps off Data Pipeline, an infrastructure product that will let its users create links between their Stripe transaction data and data stores that they keep in Amazon Redshift or Snowflake’s Data Cloud.
As our own Ingrid Lunden puts it, the move underscores how Stripe is positioning itself as more than just a payments provider. It has ambitions to be a larger financial services and data powerhouse, a “financial infrastructure platform for businesses” in its own words. Isn’t that what Plaid is?
So, in essence, Plaid is becoming more like Stripe and Stripe is becoming more like Plaid. Not at all confusing.
Plaid’s recent moves are less unexpected than they might seem at the surface — beyond the related recent acquisitions it has made. Recall that Visa almost bought Plaid for $5.3 billion before that deal fell apart in early 2021 due to regulatory concerns. The potential combination first gained a higher level of complexity when, in November 2020, the Department of Justice sued to block Visa’s proposed purchase of Plaid. The DOJ asserted that Visa was buying Plaid to eliminate a competitor in the world of online debit transactions. Visa denied that assertion, stating that Plaid was not a payments company and, therefore, not a direct competitor.
But one of the things that came out at that time was that Visa in fact did view Plaid as a potential competitor, with one executive likening the startup to an island “volcano” whose capabilities at that time were just “the tip showing above the water,” warning that “what lies beneath, though, is a massive opportunity — one that threatens Visa.” And when conducting due diligence in the acquisition process, Visa’s senior executives reportedly grew alarmed by Plaid’s plans to add “a meaningful money movement business by the end of 2021.”
When you look back at that history, Plaid’s recent product announcements are hardly a surprise. If anything, most of us are wondering “What took them so long?” For more on Alex Wilhelm’s and my take on the topic, head here.
Meanwhile, in Mexico, retail brokerage startup Flink, which claims to be the first in its home country to offer fractional shares directly from the New York Stock Exchange, said it will be buying Vifaru Casa de Bolsa, subject to approval from the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV, by its acronym in Spanish). Why is this a big deal? It marks the first time in Mexico that a startup is acquiring a brokerage firm under the supervision of regulatory authorities. Once the deal closes, Flink says it will create new financial products “for millions of Mexicans to invest.”
“At Flink, our mission is to create a much more equitable ecosystem, where anyone can access quality financial services. Therefore, this transaction is a great step toward fulfilling our objective of generating true financial inclusion in the country and the region,” said Flink CEO and co-founder Sergio Jiménez Amozurrutia in a press release.
It’s not the first time that a startup has acquired an existing financial institution. In September 2020, I wrote about how mobile banking startup Jiko Group bought Mid-Central National Bank in Wadena, Minnesota. In that case, both the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco approved the transaction. But it was a process. “The deal came after 3 years of ‘rigorous’ R&D, testing and auditing, the company said.”
More recently, Plaid co-founder William Hockey — who left the company in 2019 — purchased a community bank (Northern California National Bank or NorCal) for $50 million last year. He rebranded it to Column, his latest startup, which he believes is the first financial institution of its kind: a “financial infrastructure” bank.
I find it kind of fascinating when fintechs buy incumbents, and I expect we’ll only continue to see more of it.
Also last week, Square continues to integrate Afterpay into its offering, by extending buy now, pay later (BNPL) functionality to in-person sellers, meaning consumers now can use BNPL to make purchases at local businesses in the United States and Australia. The $29 billion deal closed in January.
Also, in the world of BNPL, London-based Zilch — which was valued at $2 billion last November — announced its launch into the U.S. market. Launching with over 150,000 pre-registered customers, Zilch says its arrival in the U.S. follows a huge growth period, reaching over 2 million customers in the 18 months since it launched in the U.K.
In other (big) BNPL news, the Wall Street Journal reported that Klarna aims to raise up to $1 billion from new and existing backers in a deal that could value the company “at almost a third less than the $45.9 billion valuation it achieved just under a year ago,” or in the value in the low $30-billion-range, post-money. TC’s own Alex Wilhelm has thoughts about that. Read them here.
Meanwhile, Revolut co-founder Nik Storonsky announced that he plans to launch his own venture fund, powered by artificial intelligence, to compete with “legacy” venture capital investors, reports Forbes. Storonsky said he will himself invest, with others, around $200 million into the Quantum Light Capital fund.
And, cryptocurrency exchange FTX said it is launching stock trading capabilities for its customers through its U.S. division. The company, helmed by co-founder and billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, said that its launch will start in private beta mode for a select group of customers chosen from a waitlist before a full rollout in late 2022. Anita Ramaswamy gives us all the details here.

Fundings and M&A
Last week, I (exclusively) covered two raises that related to the residential real estate market, which is an increasing area of interest for VCs as of late. In this case, both were renter-focused. First off, I wrote about Arrived — a proptech that raised $25 million in a Series A funding round led by Forerunner Ventures to give people the ability to buy shares in single-family rentals with “as little as $100.” Returning backers included Bezos Expeditions, the personal investment company of Jeff Bezos; Good Friends, a venture fund run by the CEOs and co-founders of Warby Parker, Harry’s and Allbirds, as well as Spencer Rascoff, co-founder and former CEO of Zillow.
The concept of fractional real estate investing is not a new one. But what stood out about Arrived is that it claims to be the first in the space that is “fully SEC-qualified,” meaning that it has approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer shares of individual homes. In other words, it’s essentially creating house IPOs, or taking houses public. As a former real estate reporter, I can’t help but geek out when tech and real estate intersect. Especially when companies give everyday Americans greater access to investing in a way they couldn’t before.
I also wrote about Belong, a three-sided marketplace that provides services for homeowners who are both landlords and renters.
From the homeowner perspective, Belong offers home management services that it says makes owning a rental home easier. For example, if a rental property needs a repair, the startup has an in-house maintenance team that can handle those on a landlord’s behalf. It also provides the homeowners with financial tools to manage their investment, as well as guaranteed rent on the first of each month. And it will also help an owner fix up a property and get it in rental-ready shape.
On the renters side, Belong says it has created a system that gives them a way to build home ownership themselves. For example, with each one-time rent payment, residents get around 3% of the price of rent back, which accumulates in an account with the aim of being used toward a down payment on the purchase of a home — but only if it’s used to buy a home through its platform. You see, the company serves as a real estate brokerage as well.
Belong just secured $80 million — $50 million in equity and $30 million in debit. Fifth Wall preempted the round, which also included participation from repeat backers Battery Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and GGV Capital.
My favorite line in this story was from Belong CEO and co-founder Ale Resnik, who said part of the company’s goal is to make renters not feel like “second-class citizens.” There’s a bigger story here on why startups focused on the rental market seem to be attracting venture dollars. One of these days, I’ll write it.
Meanwhile, infrastructure continues to rake in the big bucks. Xendit, a payments infrastructure platform for Southeast Asia, raised $300 million in fresh funding. The company’s new valuation wasn’t disclosed, but it hit unicorn status in its last round of funding in September 2021. And, BaaS startup Unit closed on a $100 million round at a $1.2 billion valuation. Speaking of infrastructure, payments infra startup Finix announced some new product news last week, including the fact that it is now a registered payment facilitator and has expanded its in-person payments capabilities and added real-time fraud monitoring.
In LatAm, UnDosTres, a Mexican fintech company working on airtime top-ups, service payments and entertainment purchases, announced it closed on a $30 million Series B led by IDC Investments.
And Nomad, a Brazilian fintech company that allows Brazilians to open a 100% digital banking/investment account in a North American bank, raised $32 million just 9 months after their first round. Stripes led the latest financing. The company says it has amassed 300,000 customers in less than 18 months of operations. Speaking of Brazil, check out this feature I did on Neon, a digital bank with 16 million customers in its home country focused on the working class.
Trellis, a company that wants to help people pay less money for their car insurance and make it easier to switch with its API, raised $5 million from Amex Ventures.
Caribou, a fintech whose mission is to help people take control of their car payments, closed on $115 million in an “oversubscribed” Series C funding round, which valued the company at $1.1 billion. Goldman Sachs Asset Management led the financing, expanding its services across the auto financial landscape, recently launching its digital car insurance marketplace.
That’s it for this week…Wishing you all a wonderful Sunday and week ahead. Thanks for reading!

"BUD, a nascent app taking a shot at creating a metaverse for Gen Z to play and interact with each other, has raised another round of funding in three months.
The Singapore-based startup told TechCrunch that it has closed $36.8 million in a Series B round led by Sequoia Capital India, not long after it secured a Series A extension in February. The new infusion brings BUD’s total financing to over $60 million.
As with BUD’s previous rounds, this round of raise attracted a handful of prominent China-focused investors — ClearVue Partners, NetEase and Northern Light Venture Capital. Its existing investors GGV Capital, Qiming Venture Partners and Source Code Capital also participated in the round.
Founded by two former Snap engineers Risa Feng and Shawn Lin in 2019, BUD lets users create bulbous 3D characters, cutesy virtual assets and richly colored experiences through drag-and-drop and without any coding background.
The company declined to reveal its active user size but said its users have created over 15 million custom experiences i.e., virtual spaces with gameplay that others can join since the app launched in November. Virtual assets, including costumes and accessories that users design for characters, have changed hands more than 150 million times on BUD’s marketplace.
These transactions are clearly a promising way to generate revenues, but BUD is not charging commissions for now. Nor has it started monetizing in other means via the app.
Perhaps partly due to its free-to-use and ad-free nature, the app has been among the top 10 social apps in nearly 40 countries across North America, Southeast Asia and South America. It’s currently the top free social Android app in Thailand and Vietnam, according to market intelligence company SensorTower.
Apps like Roblox and South Korea’s Zepeto have also made it easier for anyone to design virtual characters and spaces. BUD is taking the user experience a step further with plans to introduce a marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). That means the ownership of virtual items sold on BUD will be recorded on the blockchain. Reselling of digital assets will likely become possible in the form of NFTs, of which authenticity and provenance can be more easily verified.
BUD declined to disclose which chain the NFT project will be on or what tokens it will use, but said the marketplace will “soon be live.”
“While BUD makes 3D content creation possible for mainstream Gen Z consumers, we will continue to bring blockchain to mainstream consumers and allow our creators to truly own and monetize their creations,” said Lin in a statement.
The company is quickly expanding and has a team of 130 employees spread across its headquarters in Singapore as well as its offices in Shenzhen and the U.S.

"As bad economic news piles up seemingly on a daily basis, we don’t know what the future holds except that change is on the way. Although we are seeing layoffs and hiring freezes at some companies, it doesn’t necessarily mean the talent crunch will immediately abate.
There will likely be some lag before we start to see the tight job market we’ve experienced for the last couple of years begin to loosen. Even then, there are certain fields like engineering, data science and cybersecurity, where tech companies large and small could still struggle to find talent no matter what the macroeconomic conditions look like.
Over the last month, we have seen an increase in the number of startup layoff announcements at companies like Cameo, On Deck and Robinhood. Meanwhile, big companies like Netflix, Meta and Uber have announced hiring freezes, with the consumer streaming service throwing some layoffs into the mix as well.
Despite this onslaught of bad news, for now, most startup founders, investors and HR pros don’t see the job market magically improving for hiring departments, at least in the near term. That means the folks in charge of hiring are still going to have to shake the bushes for talent.
Matt Hoffman, partner and head of talent at VC firm M13 and a former HR pro, said for a lot of people, the desire to be a part of something and help it grow is in some ways a stronger motivator than perks and pay. That’s good news for startups looking for talent.
“I’ve always believed that people don’t join a company just for the economic benefits. They join for the opportunity to have an impact and to grow. And so in a lot of cases, it may be a more opportune time to take a chance in an early-stage company because you can focus on that long-term horizon, and you can get that opportunity to grow and have an impact,” Hoffman told me.
For employees, he said there will still be opportunities at good companies in any economic conditions, but attracting talent always comes down to creating a good place to work.
“Even in the tightest of economic environments — and we’re not there yet — there’s always going to be high demand for the best talent. Always. So the things that you need to do to attract, engage and retain these employees does not change,” he said.

"Hey everyone, and welcome back to Chain Reaction.
In our Chain Reaction podcast this week, Anita and I chatted with Mercedes Bent of Lightspeed Venture Partners on backing blockchain startups and the future of consumer fintech. More details below.
Last week, we talked about how the crypto industry needs to take a moment to reflect on buying the love of its followers. This week, we’re looking at the unhappy misfortunes of America’s favorite public crypto company

the hottest take
Though crypto markets have been relatively stable since last week’s bombastic dump-o-rama, gloom was on the menu this week for institutional investors and retail buyers prophesying crypto winters falling upon all ye households for the next several years.
The message from VCs to crypto startups and mega corps alike was “cut the fat” — a statement which doesn’t jibe too well with the lavish launch parties and plans to quintuple hiring that plenty of founders seemed to be working toward last month. It’s been a period of unprecedented boom for crypto startups, but life has been looking a bit less pleasant for Coinbase since Bitcoin and the public markets hit their frothy peak in November of last year.
Coinbase is currently trading below $65 per share after a more than 80% decline from its November all-time high. A lot of other public market tech stocks are also feeling the hurt, but relative to just how much revenue Coinbase pulled in last year, it’s clear investors have nuked their expectations for the company’s future performance. Coinbase did $7.4 billion in net revenue in 2021 and is currently rocking a market cap below $14 billion. That’s nuts.
Public market investors may not have the rosiest view of Coinbase, but the question is how this really impacts the company. Well, the firm is adjusting its growth expectations for one thing. COO Emilie Choi announced this week that the company was hitting the brakes, “Heading into this year, we planned to triple the size of the company. Given current market conditions, we feel it’s prudent to slow hiring and reassess…”
This is expected, but isn’t great for a company that has several cash-swolen competitors all chasing their market share. The company has been diversifying its offerings looking to leverage its network and provide more of a browser for the nascent web3 world, but it’s unclear what kind of consumer pickup the crypto world is looking at over the next year compared to the past couple, something which has left the company in a fairly grim position for the near-term…

the latest podcast
Hey, it’s Anita, here to give you an update on our latest episode of Chain Reaction, where we unpack the latest web3 news, block-by-block for the crypto-curious. 
In this episode, we talked about 30-year-old blockchain billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) buying a 7.6% stake in Robinhood and what he could possibly be planning to do to help turn around the struggling exchange amid a rough first half of the year. We also explained the difference between custodial and non-custodial wallets, since Robinhood just announced it’s launching the latter — the latest in a spate of new products intended to attract more users to its platform. 

Since we talked about Robinhood, we had to go over what’s up with its competitor, Coinbase, which said this week that it would be slowing its hiring plans because of the crypto market crash. We also gave listeners an update on the latest with the disgraced UST — the stablecoin that (kind of) started it all.
Our guest this week was Mercedes Bent, an investor at Lightspeed Venture Partners who helped us unpack the loaded term that is the “metaverse” and talked about some of the long-term potential she’s seeing in sectors like web3 video games.

Animoca Brands plans to add education to its multibillion-dollar NFT and gaming business
Animoca Brands has grown into one of the biggest firms in the metaverse, play-to-earn gaming and NFT worlds, but its co-founder Yat Siu told TechCrunch there’s a new sector the company wants to enter: education. No, not education about crypto topics, but more general educational tooling that could apply to more than one discipline. Siu said he hopes to drive the teacher economy with a “learn-to-earn” or “teach-to-earn” model, so both teachers’ and students’ time can be rewarded in the form of a token or cash. This push could be a new wave for the crypto ecosystem to implement additional ways to earn rewards.

"Founders have gotten the memo that the ground is shifting under their feet right now. What to do about it is the question. Already, teams are making plans to scale back their spending to preserve capital. They’re making painful staff cuts toward that same end — or else instituting hiring freezes.
But they should also be thinking a lot harder about building relationships with bankers and the larger companies that might conceivably be interested in acquiring their startup, say two attorneys who work on both the ‘buy’ and ‘sell’ side of transactions, with both large companies and venture-backed outfits, and who both have more than 20 years of experience.
Indeed, to better understand some of the options founders may have, we talked earlier today with Denny Kwon and Scott Anthony, both of whom represent the white shoe law firm Covington & Burling (where former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is also an attorney). They answered a range of questions that we thought startups might be wondering about right now. Our chat has been edited lightly for length.
TC: How much has the world changed in the last few weeks?
DK: There is certainly a feeling of more pressure on sellers to get deals done as quickly as possible in light of the fact that there’s a lot of market volatility right now and they don’t know how buyers may be reacting to a significant decline in their stock price. Smaller companies are also facing the prospect of a slightly more challenging fundraising market, so alternatives for them are narrowing.
TC: Given that public shares are so volatile right now, are acquirers more or less inclined to offer equity as a component of a deal? 
DK: It’s much more challenging to price deals with a significant stock component in this market. With any volatility, you don’t get a clear sense of the inherent value of a share, so all-cash deals are much more favorable to targets.
TC: Are targets in a position right now to make demands? How much leverage does a startup with dwindling options really have?
DK: Whenever we see volatile markets, where valuations were incredibly high [and are] being reset, it always takes time for sellers’ expectations to reset as well, so although they may be a temporary [lull in activity] because of the market, if there’s a ‘normalization’ that’s to come, we’ll probably see M&A activity, especially where valuation expectations are reduced on both the buyers’ and the sellers’ side.
My sense [right now] is that buyers may view the market correction as being potentially opportunistic but sellers may not have the same expectations because they may hope for a rebound in the near future. Once seller expectations come down and they continue to hear from VCs that funding may not be as available as it was 6 to 12 months ago, they’ll be even harder pressed to turn away acquisition offers that come in.
TC: Are you seeing deals being yanked as buyers look to reprice earlier agreements to their benefit?
DK: The pending deals I’m working on are continuing apace.
TC: We’re all hearing — and reading — about very steep valuation drops already. Do you have any sense of how much value your clients have lost in recent weeks or whether certain sectors are getting hit harder than others?
SA:There’s valuation pressure, but it’s hard to gauge [the degree]. Certainly, we have companies that were racing to close valuations [before Russia invaded Ukraine] and [that period since] has changed everyone’s expectations. I think there’s concern on the company side that investors are sitting out and that’s driving valuations down.
Companies with revenues and good prospects will weather any downturn better — they always have. Sector wise, it will depend, but the whole stablecoin [debacle] hasn’t helped the crypto stuff.
TC: How big a concern are antitrust regulators to your bigger clients? 
DK: It’s top of mind for all practitioners, but there’s a dichotomy in that some transactions are reportable and others are not. For those that are reportable — the threshold is approximately $100 million —  we’re spending an incredible amount of time analyzing the potential for regulatory issues.
TC: How long does an M&A process take, and at what point do both sides agree on a price?
DK: From that initial approach from an acquirer, the time period can vary from a few weeks if there is alignment right away, up to several months if the target company wants to see if there is other interest. A lot depends on how compelling that first offer may appear. Once you get to a handshake on a valuation, it’s usually a six- to eight-week process to get a signed definitive agreement.
SA: If the [startup] is the one that is making the decision to find a buyer, then the process – maybe they hire bankers, maybe they use board members’ connections to reach out to strategics – the process and timing can be very different depending on how quickly they need the money and how quickly they can get potential buyers interested . . . and the size of the company, but buyers are still going to run their diligence process.
TC: Let’s assume M&A will be a more significant factor, given the cooling funding environment. If you were to advise a startup on the pros and cons about proceeding, what points would you make?
DK: Many companies at an inflection point that need to raise money to fund their growth or expansion are going to have a difficult decision to make, which is to either raise a new round where the valuation may not meet their expectations or [where they see a lot of dilution], or an M&A exit, where they see proceeds now but lose out on [potential] upside.
TC: Should startups that are open to selling be reaching out to anyone, or should they wait to see who approaches them? Some might worry their startup’s value will drop as soon as they indicate a willingness to sell.
DK:  I’d be advising startups to talk to bankers and keep relationships up with people at the larger companies they know simply because we may be in for a longer-term correction, where funding becomes even more challenging than it has been over the last couple of months.
SA: Having relationships with the bankers is prudent so if you have to check the market, you have those relationships already. Also, keeping in contact with customers and bigger strategic partners that would be natural buyers for the company could short-circuit any kind of sale process later.",,,2022-05-20T23:29:49,Why founders should start talking now to bankers and potential buyers

The TechCrunch Top 3

UST UGH: Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon has some ’splaining to do with South Korea’s special financial crimes unit, which has launched an investigation into the collapse of Terraform’s stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) and its sister token Luna earlier this month. Prosecutors might be first in line, but the line is growing, with investors filing a lawsuit against Kwon and his co-founder Daniel Shin over alleged charges of fraud and other financial regulation violations. Also joining are Luna Foundation Guard advisors who tell Jacquie that they have not heard from Kwon in weeks.
Standoff: We enjoyed reading Carly’s piece outlining what happened with Costa Rica’s ransomware attacks — the Conti gang is attempting to overthrow the government — and who could be next. As of our newsletter time, the ransom part was still going on. The deadline given was May 23.
Klarna konundrum: The payments company is reportedly the latest to be fine with lowering its valuation, and in its case, there is some capital attached. We think Alex sums it up well saying, “No one likes a down round. They are dilutive, messy and demoralizing. But they are also miles better than not raising money and dying, so companies raise them when required.” He goes into why Klarna taking an insider round with a cut valuation is worth it or not.

Startups and VC
Today, we got a wee bit excited about Haje’s somewhat-expletive-filled rant about Coca-Cola’s new bottle caps that don’t detach from the bottle, against a backdrop of greenwashing.
We also loved Brian’s piece about Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky’s love for small phones. “If no one else makes one I guess I will be forced to make it myself,” Migicovsky laments.
Also, Brian and Haje tag-teamed on a pair of articles about Sony’s new earbuds. Brian covers the buds themselves (“As someone who tests a lot of earbuds over the course of a year, the LinkBuds S are among the best sounding and most comfortable I’ve had in my ears”), and Haje double-clicked on the Endel soundscape-creating app.

Three things to remember when diversifying your startup’s cap table

Just as a sales team builds and refines its funnel, early stage founders in fundraising mode can create an investor funnel that will help sustain their company for years to come.
Oriana Papin-Zoghbi, CEO and co-founder of women’s health startup AOA Dx, shared her investor breakdown with TC+:

35% private investors
34% women (female investors or female-headed funds)
26% venture capitalists
23% family and friends
18% international investors
15% angel groups

“When building an investor funnel, vocalizing what you want is crucial to finding the right investors,” says Papin-Zoghbi.
“Finding the right investors is like finding the right team members — you need to be upfront about your expectations and address what you want them to bring to the table.”

Deposit 25 cents: If you’re a gamer, we presume you have some thoughts on God of War: Ragnarök. Devin’s take is that this game “may be the most accessible title yet, and that’s saying something.” It’s good to see Microsoft create a game that offers features that are customizable for people with certain specific disabilities, like a visual or hearing impairment.
The family that Snaps together stays together: For every parent dying to know who their teen is interacting with on Snapchat, the social media giant is close to launching its parental control feature, “Family Center.” For those of you not on Snapchat, or don’t have children, Sarah tells us this is important because it is one of the few social networks where you can’t see someone’s friend list.

“You can often pick up significant market share in an economic downturn by just staying alive,” top startup accelerator Y Combinator wrote in an internal email to its founders this week. The advice was one of 10 bullet points in a memo meant to help its companies navigate the economic downturn crushing tech. Other standout quotes include “plan for the worst” and “no one can predict how bad the economy will get, but things don’t look good.”
The email is a vibe shift from just a few weeks ago, when hundreds of Y Combinator startups — many of which already raised venture funding — presented themselves to the public on Demo Day. The startups were the first to receive Y Combinator’s new $500,000 standard deal and were aggressively focused on international opportunity. Now, after that bonanza, YC is saying that “this slowdown will have a disproportionate impact on international companies” among others.
Y Combinator isn’t the only one publishing a “black swan” memo in preparation for what’s to come. TechCrunch obtained a series of memos that venture capitalist firms sent to portfolio companies about the market downturn. Some were hopeful, some were simple, and others were a vibe check as straightforward as: Can you tell us your ARR and cash burn in writing?
High efficiency > high growth

"Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner spacecraft has had a rough couple years, but this afternoon it successfully docked with the International Space Station, its first successful mission to orbit. Despite a few hiccups, this launch went more or less as planned, and if the craft can return to Earth safely that will make this a huge accomplishment for the beleaguered aerospace company.
Without recapping all the troubles the Starliner has had, let it suffice to say that delays upon delays led some to question whether this capsule would ever make it to orbit, to say nothing of making regular trips with crew aboard.
But naysayers may have to hold their tongues, at least for a week or two, after the Starliner’s successful launch and orbital insertion yesterday. and what appeared to be a textbook docking procedure this afternoon. Check out this great shot of the capsule during its “inbound flyaround”:


The @BoeingSpace #Starliner fires its engines to begin its flyaround of the station for a 7:10pm ET docking today. https://t.co/yuOTrZ4Jut pic.twitter.com/hKXgYU2fgQ
— International Space Station (@Space_Station) May 20, 2022

That’s not to say there were no problems whatsoever. Two orbital maneuvering and attitude control (OMAC) thrusters, which are exactly as important as they sound, had to be shut off during the insertion burn due to “a chamber drop in pressure.” There is also “off-nominal behavior of a thermal cooling loop.”
Naturally there are redundancies and tolerances in place for these kinds of things, and the Starliner continued on its merry way. But a multiple thruster failure isn’t something you can shrug off as “space is hard.” This was neither the first time the craft has been in space, nor its first time having thrust problems.
You better believe NASA, which has paid Boeing handsomely to develop this equipment, is going to be looking at this event through an electron microscope before committing another dime to the program.
Nevertheless, the spacecraft did complete its official orbital mission — a first for the Starliner — and a huge amount of things have to go right for that to happen. That’s definitely a win for Boeing, and they really needed one of those.
Plus they got this really awesome view, which looks fake but is definitely real:

"If you’ve been following Netflix lately, then you’d know the streamer is on shaky ground at the moment. Antenna data reveals that Netflix saw 3.6 million subscription cancellations in the first quarter of 2022, over one million more than the company experienced in Q1 2021 and Q4 2021. This is a significant indicator that Netflix is inching closer to losing its top spot in the streaming battle.
While Netflix’s downfall has raised speculations about if the SVOD (subscription video on demand) industry has peaked and is beginning a downward trend, new Antenna data supports the contrary.
Antenna discovered that U.S. Subscriptions in the Premium SVOD category grew +4.0% quarter over quarter and by +24.7% year over year. The research also shows that there were 37.4 million new gross SVOD customers and a loss of 29.8 million subscribers, leaving a gross of just 7.7 million new subscribers in the first quarter of 2022.

The 37.4 number is consistent with the past two quarters yet significantly higher than 2019 (before COVID-19). The growth was largely driven by fledgling services Peacock and Paramount+, which added a combined 6.1 million or more U.S. Subscribers.
In comparison, in 2019, when the market was dominated by Netflix and Hulu (services like Disney+, Peacock and HBO Max didn’t exist yet), there were a total of 10.3 million subscriptions in the year’s first quarter. The massive increase depicts a three-year compound annual growth rate of 54%.
While subscriber growth may be high right now, so are cancellations. There were just under 30 million cancellations in Q1 2022, which is 12% higher than any quarter in history, or 4.5 times the cancel volume seen three years prior, Antenna finds.
The cancellations may not be anything to worry about since the new subscriber additions indicate consumers are bouncing around — also known as churn and return. Paramount+, Peacock and Disney+ accounted for 51% of all new sign-ups in the quarter. Plus, the three mentioned services made up a large portion of new sign-ups for the churned Q1 2022 Netflix users.

Peter Fondulas, principal at Hub, stated, “Netflix’s subscriber loss in Q1 of 2022, and its anticipated losses in the following quarters, represent a tiny proportion of its global subscriber base. And in fact, at some point, a service as widely penetrated as Netflix has only so much room left to grow. In our view, it would be a grave mistake to take the Netflix experience as a sign that streaming TV services are on the verge of decline, as some analysts have suggested. The lure of buzzworthy exclusive content, and the sheer convenience of on-demand viewing, are two powerful forces that should keep these services growing at least for the near term.”
In Q1 2022, Netflix reported a loss of 200,000 subscribers, making its first subscriber loss in more than 10 years. The decline brought Netflix’s subscriber base to 221.6 million, down from 221.8 million in the previous quarter. The losses will only continue, according to Netflix forecasts, and the streamer is expected to lose 2 million in the second quarter.
Since Netflix raised prices on all its plan tiers domestically in January 2022, there has been a major jump in subscription cancellations. The Netflix U.S. active monthly churn rate was a little over 2% in January 2019, after it raised subscription prices.
Further, Antenna data shows that Netflix’s active monthly churn rate increased +0.95 pts month over month in January 2022, where a price jump led to an active monthly churn rate of 3%. By the end of March, Netflix’s active monthly churn rate was 3.3%. This suggests that Netflix’s upcoming cheaper ad-supported tier is the company’s plan to minimize churn.

All this data goes to show how volatile the streaming market is. It’s hard to predict which service will be on top next, but established streamers like Netflix need to be on their toes and come up with new strategies to attract new subscribers.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.44-PM.png,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/antenna-streaming-1536x768-1.webp,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-11.49.36-AM.png,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.35-PM.png","https://www.antenna.live/post/netflix-q122-retrospective,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.44-PM.png,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/antenna-streaming-1536x768-1.webp,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-16-at-11.49.36-AM.png,https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/new-research-suggests-the-streaming-party-isnt-over,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/19/netflix-shares-down-more-than-20-after-losing-200000-subscribers-in-first-quarter/,https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/14/netflix-raised-its-prices-again/,https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/netflix-price-hike/,https://www.antenna.live/post/double-click-on-netflix-q122-churned-users,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/10/netflix-could-introduce-its-ad-supported-plan-as-soon-as-this-year/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-13-at-12.54.35-PM.png",2022-05-21T14:00:37,Premium streaming subscriptions continue to increase despite Netflix&#8217;s downfall
"Pear, a Palo Alto, Ca.-based venture firm that we’ve been tracking since its outset in 2012, looks to be raising a fourth fund that’s targeting $410 million in capital commitments, shows a new SEC filing.
It would be a big step up from Pear’s first three funds, which closed progressively with $50 million in 2013, $75 million in 2016 and $160 million in capital commitments in 2019, including from a longtime limited partner, the University of Chicago.
Reached for comment, co-founder Pejman Nozad emailed back, “I can’t comment!”
Nozad and co-founder Mar Hershenson have long been the first stop for prominent early-stage investors that are looking to fund nascent teams, given the firm has been among the earliest backers in a notable number of companies that have gone to raise ever-bigger rounds and higher valuations, including the now publicly traded companies DoorDash and Guardant Health.
Other startups to attract capital from Pear before nearly any other firm was aware of their existence include the deep-linking startup Branch, which closed on $300 million in funding in February at a $4 billion valuation; Gusto, valued at $9.5 billion last summer when it raised $175 million in funding; and Aurora Solar, a firm that provides software services for the solar industry and was valued at $4 billion in February when it closed a $200 million round.
Like other firms, Pear is likely to see the valuations of its still-private portfolio companies slide downward — possibly by a lot — depending on how long this correction lasts.
Hershenson, who joined TechCrunch for a mobility-focused event this week, noted on stage that startups are in for a bumpy ride, given how frothy the market had grown.
Asked if the startup party is over, Hershenson answered: “Maybe for a little while it’s over … The problem is that the market was priced too high in 2021, and we’re all adjusting to that price change, and that changes how companies raise money.
“Everybody knows that the stock market is down a lot,” she’d said. “Software stocks are down in some cases 80%. [Meanwhile] if you’re a private company, and you were very lucky and you raised money in 2021, you may have gotten a multiple of 100x on your ARR. Today, those multiples are 10x or 20x. That means that if your company was $2 billion [at the time of your fundraise], your company is [now] worth $200 million.”
Even with a steep reset in prices, however, Pear’s success to date is undeniable. It’s also unlikely.
Nozad, very famously, was earlier a rug dealer who insisted on toting rugs to his clients’ homes, where during the course of long conversations, they would learn about the rug and he would learn about their business. He eventually became a scout for his boss and a trusted friend to some very powerful people.
“He has a good sniffer, and I trust the guy,”  Sequoia’s Doug Leone told Forbes back in 2012. “He’s like me, from the earth.” Sequoia has, in fact, backed a number of companies that Pear has funded, including Guardant Health and DoorDash.
Meanwhile, his partner, Mar Hershenson, was also very much an outlier when the two struck out on their own. Despite founding several companies previously — one of which Nozad backed — and though she holds an M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University, she is a native of Spain and even more unusual in VC circles a decade ago, she is a woman who had not previously cut her teeth at someone else’s venture firm.
That may not seem very notable today but in 2012, but it put Hershenson in rare company.
As for the team’s newest bets, Pear hosted an invite-only demo day earlier this week, coverage of which we’ll have for readers soon. (Unlike Y Combinator, the outfit holds a demo day each year for a comparatively limited number of companies — typically around 10.)
In the meantime, some of its other recent checks have gone to Sudozi, a two-year-old Austin, Texas startup that provides a SaaS platform to help enterprises improve their money management capabilities and that just this month announced a $4.3 million seed round led by Pear.
Pear also recently wrote a follow-on check to Osmind, a two-year-old, Bay Area-based startup that makes software to chart and update patient information and documents, with a focus on mental health. The outfit raised $40 million in Series B funding led by DFJ Growth, an announcement it also made earlier this month.

Deep tech has become a hot topic in Europe, with hopes that the region can have an edge over the rest of the world for innovation rooted in fundamental research. One of the key arguments: European countries have great universities and talent. But how can academic talent translate into startups? Let’s dive in. — Anna
Universities, a deep tech cauldron
“From startups to universities, we join forces to make Europe a world leader in the new wave of deep tech innovation!” European commissioner Mariya Gabriel tweeted earlier this week after her talk at the Tech.eu Summit in Brussels. As I noticed while attending the event, she was far from the only one to mention this topic enthusiastically.
That deep tech raises high hopes in Europe wasn’t exactly a surprise. Alex and I already wrote about Europe’s deep tech boom and investor interest in it earlier this year. But the role that educational institutions are expected to play piqued my interest.

VCs weigh in on Europe’s future in the critical deep tech market

“There is no doubt that the future of innovation in Europe will emerge from its world-leading universities,” Riam Kanso wrote in a Tech.eu guest post ahead of the event. Kanso is the founder of Conception X, which I had coincidentally heard about for the first time earlier this month. The U.K.-based nonprofit aims to transform Ph.D. researchers into venture scientists.
“It’s a simple but well-proven recipe,” Kanso said. “You have a Ph.D. team working on cutting-edge research with key real-world applications. They know their innovation could help discover effective treatments for now-incurable diseases, power up carbon-negative cities or tackle the future of automation. Through a combination of entrepreneurship training, access to pro-bono legal advice, funding opportunities and expert connections, we help them figure out how to turn their research into a viable deep tech startup.”
It isn’t a new thing for universities to more or less willingly give birth to spinoffs or spinouts (we will use the terms interchangeably here.) MIT, for instance, is famous for counting many entrepreneurs among its alumni, and quite a few of these ventures are based on intellectual property developed during their studies or research.
But in Europe, intellectual property can be a thorny issue. The “potential for meaningful innovation brewing across Europe’s research labs,” Kanso said, “largely remains untapped due to varying — and at times stifling — IP ownership rules that can make spinout companies uninvestable and hard to scale.”
Increasingly though, both European universities and venture capital firms are making efforts to make sure the most promising seeds turn into successful companies.
Mind the gap
Despite the hurdles, VCs looking for innovation know that spinouts are very much worth their attention. “As an investor in early-stage businesses, many with a deeply technical nature, we see universities as foundational to the companies we invest in,” said Simon King, himself a VC with a Ph.D.",,"https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/,https://techcrunch.com/newsletters,https://twitter.com/abracarioca,https://twitter.com/gabrielmariya/status/1526526944778518535,https://twitter.com/alex,https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/17/why-you-shouldnt-ignore-europes-deep-tech-boom/,https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/24/vcs-weigh-in-on-europes-future-in-the-critical-deep-tech-market/,https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/24/vcs-weigh-in-on-europes-future-in-the-critical-deep-tech-market/,https://tech.eu/2022/04/13/how-training-phd-students-in-deeptech-entrepreneurship-can-spur-european-innovation,https://conceptionx.org/,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/03/deal-flow-newsletter-preseed-now-to-introduce-future-uk-crown-jewels-to-investors/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_founded_by_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_alumni,https://sifted.eu/articles/university-tech-transfer-overhaul/",2022-05-21T17:01:53,Europe&#8217;s deep tech depends on university spinouts

If there’s one thing TC is great at, it’s rolling with the punches and improvising on the fly, and we did that with on-location and remote recording, bringing you highlights from the biggest news of the week alongside in-depth interviews with TC’s own Kirsten Korosec and Taylor Hatmaker.
Be sure to subscribe, and leave us a 5-star review with your feedback. We’ll be delivering the TechCrunch Podcast weekly, with fresh interviews from the writers closest to the biggest stories of the week, as well as a roundup of what you need to know for what went down in the wide world of tech.

Chain Reaction
Episode 6: Lightspeed’s web3 guru on consumer crypto startups and the metaverse (with Mercedes Bent)

Welcome back, this week Lucas and Anita discuss the continued fallout from the broader market crash and how life is going for crypto giants on the public markets. We chat about FTX’s 30-year-old billionaire CEO buying up a big chunk of Robinhood, which is pumping the gas on crypto even as the market cools. We also discuss trouble at Coinbase and the continued fallout from the collapse of Terra.
In their interview this week, Lucas and Anita chat with Mercedes Bent. Bent is a venture capitalist at Lightspeed Venture Partners where she places bets on consumer products in cryptoland. Before joining Lightspeed, Bent spent some time in the VR world, so we picked her brain on where crypto fits into this metaverse future everyone is clamoring about.

Episode 518: A Twitter Bot Wrote This


The whole team was back together this week, which was pretty darn good as there was a lot to get through. Alex Wilhelm, Natasha Mascarenhas and Mary Ann Azevedo were on the mic, with Grace handling production.
What did we get into? A better question might be what did we not get into:

We started with an update from the TechCrunch Mobility event, thanks to Natasha who is on-site and up in the air.
From there it was time to talk deals, with the crew parsing Arrived’s latest round, and why Kolkata Chai took some external capital, but very much on its own terms.
Then it was time to chat Zenly’s new mapping news, and why startups are critical when it comes to taking on incumbents.
From there we had to ask if Elon Musk really wants to buy Twitter (seemingly no?), and how tired we are about the topic itself.
Then we chatted through the recent unicorn vibe check that the market got, and the fact that most unicorns are not true IPO candidates. (Along with news from SpotOn, and Unit!)
And to close, we asked about the responsibilities of tech platforms in the wake of a number of mass shootings in the United States; where should our expectations for content moderation on platforms start, and end?

Hugs from us to you, and we will talk to you Monday!
Episode 517: Is there hope for digital health startups post-Roe?


This is our Wednesday show, where we niche down to a single topic, think about a question and unpack the rest. This week, Natasha asked:  How do digital health startups build in a post-Roe world?
The question comes after Natasha’s recent Startups Weekly column, “When your startup’s core mission is set to be overturned.” The piece explores the ripple effects of the looming Roe v. Wade overturn, specifically in how it impacts startups. But, let’s not hypothesize. We brought on Kiki Freedman, the CEO and co-founder of Hey Jane, to answer our big questions about building, raising, and existing when so much regulatory scrutiny is weighing on your business. A direct-to-consumer health company that specializes in the delivery of abortion pills, Hey Jane about to kick off its fundraising process which makes for an interesting tension. The startup – especially today – really sits in the middle of two intense moments: an overturn to Roe v. Wade would threaten all of its work, and a toughening, risk-averse VC market could be a hurdle toward next financing.
Enjoy the show, and let us know if you like this interview format. Also, here’s the Found interview that we referenced during the show as well!
Episode 516: What’s ahead for crypto startups?


Hello and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines. Every Monday, Grace and Alex scour the news and record notes on what’s going on to kick off the week.
What was on our minds this morning? The following:

Global markets are generally down, albeit nothing too terrifying. The American stock market is trying to regain its footing after weeks of selling.
What’s ahead for crypto startups in the wake of the Terra/Luna meltdown? Bloomberg wonders about a general slowdown, and we look at the Crunchbase data of who backed the ill-fated stablecoin.
Startup layoffs are accelerating — not as bad as before, but enough to warrant our attention. Layoffs.FYI is back, y’all!
The Topship round, invested in by Y Combinator and Flexport, has our recent look at CVC hitting just right.

It was an awful weekend in America, which leaked into the show somewhat. Take care of one another.
A few housekeeping notes before we go: This is not a live-show week, so Equity will simply come out on Wednesday and Friday mornings. And this week is our TC Sessions: Mobility event, which you can learn more about here

"On the Chain Reaction podcast this week, we dove into a topic that tends to stir up strong emotions, even from those outside the crypto space — the metaverse. Mercedes Bent, an investor at Lightspeed Venture Partners who focuses on consumer investments in crypto, joined us to unpack this loaded term and explain why she sees its potential.
“It’s become like a punching bag,” Bent told TechCrunch. “If you think about the potential of it, and why maybe a geek like me gets excited about it, it’s because there are things you can do [in the metaverse] that you could not do in the real world.”

The prospect of attending an event with tens of thousands of other attendees across the world in the metaverse, for example, excites Bent. But even more than entertainment, Bent is enthusiastic about the potential for the metaverse to have an impact through education. She shared the hypothetical example of public school students being able to learn from the best instructors in the world in a metaverse similar to the movie “Ready Player One” — though without the dystopian elements, she qualified. Bent’s vision squares up with some of her non-crypto consumer investments at Lightspeed, such as small-group live education platform Outschool.
But what will the metaverse actually look like? When we asked Bent, who once worked for virtual reality technology company Upload, she said she used to think the metaverse had to be tied to VR technology, specifically the head-mounted display screen.
She’s since realized that what the metaverse has to offer has less to do with how users access it physically and more to do with the sense of community it can foster.
“I think what this era — the 2021 and 2022 era of the metaverse terminology — has shown is that it’s not about the headset, it’s not about what physical apparatus you use, it’s about the sense of [a] collective being together, and presence,” she added.
While VR tech itself has been around for decades, Bent posits that the metaverse gained traction as a concept last year because it offered one thing classic VR games like Second Life did not — the ability to transfer in-game currency to fiat currency. Cryptocurrency, she believes, made that switch possible.
“There was obviously in-game currency and there were obviously virtual goods you could buy before, but the ability to be able to transfer that to fiat and then go use it in the real world to pay your rent bill is just something entirely different that we didn’t have in such a mass quantity before,” Bent said.
That technological development coupled with the onset of the pandemic, which gave people the opportunity to spend more time online, gave the metaverse new life, she continued.
Skeptics think the metaverse gets a lot of hype and isn’t backed by substantial technology or user adoption. Bent said that in her experience, skepticism is to be expected for any early-stage consumer products.
“These hyped areas look really non-obvious. I mean, they don’t have traction; they’re just an idea. They’re often from a founder who hasn’t necessarily had the most pedigree, so you have to kind of take a leap of faith,” Bent said. Bent’s mission as an investor is to back “early-stage consumer companies that are unlocking wealth creation for underserved individuals and regions,” according to her website — a thesis that might help explain where she finds some of that faith.
As an early-stage consumer investor, Bent pushes back on the idea that it’s too early to fund consumer-facing crypto companies that haven’t yet honed their user experience.
“There are not very many companies [in web3] that I would say have scaled to what I would call a mass audience yet. We have Metamask, which is pretty far along, but I think all of these companies are up for grabs in terms of [whether] somebody else could come along to replace them,” Bent said. “I think we’re going to see the next WhatsApp, AOL and Google founded in short order.”

"Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh, human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.
“You can often pick up significant market share in an economic downturn by just staying alive,” top startup accelerator Y Combinator wrote in an internal e-mail to its founders this week. The advice was one of ten bullet points in a memo meant to help companies navigate the economic downturn crushing tech. Other stand-out quotes include “plan for the worst” and “no one can predict how bad the economy will get, but things don’t look good.”
The email is a vibe shift from just a few weeks ago, when hundreds of Y Combinator startups — many of which already raised venture funding — presented themselves to the public on Demo Day. The startups were the first to receive Y Combinator’s new $500,000 standard check and were aggressively focused on international opportunity. Now, YC is saying that “this slow down will have a disproportionate impact on international companies,” among others.

YC advises founders to ‘plan for the worst’ amid market teardown

While Y Combinator’s memo wasn’t meant to be public, it isn’t the only one publishing a Black Swan Memo in preparation for what’s to come. TechCrunch obtained a series of memos that venture capitalist firms sent to portfolio companies about the market downturn. Some were hopeful, some were simple, and others were a vibe check as straightforward as, Can you tell us your ARR and cash-burn in writing? Pretty please?
I explored this topic in my most recent TechCrunch+ column, “It’s not business as usual (and investors are admitting it).” Subscribe to Equity for a podcast version of this conversation next week as well! In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll address more layoffs at tech companies, ghosts showing up to $44 billion dates, and Swyft startups. As always, you can support me by forwarding this newsletter to a friend or following me on Twitter or my blog.
So. Many. Layoffs. 
May’s mad month of layoffs continues. Amanda and I wrote up a third installment of tech layoffs that rippled across all industries and stages. Employees from Section4, Carvana, DataRobot, Mural, Robinhood, On Deck, Thrasio, MainStreet and Netflix have been impacted by the workforce reductions. Some bigger companies are instituting hiring freezes, such as Twitter and Meta, or announcing a shift in strategy, such as Uber.
Here’s why it’s important: At time of publication, employees from Picsart, Netflix, Cars24 and Skillz were impacted by this week’s wave of reductions. It tells us who is vulnerable from a business model perspective — such as subscription-based businesses and marketplaces — and that companies may start to conduct more than one round of layoffs in the same month (cough, cough, Netflix).

On Equity this week, your favorite podcast trio spoke about unicorn vibes, property ownership tech plays and, as you can tell by the headline, the latest in the Elon Musk Twitter story. At this point, we’re deciding if it’s even worth trying to keep track of the timeline.
Here’s why it’s important: Our weekly digest of tech news is a good way to track the big news items that shape this wonky landscape, and stay aware of deals that may have flown under your radar. In this case, we spent the biggest chunk of time deciding why Elon Musk is ghosting the $44 billion date that he made with Twitter. The answer, not so complicatedly, seems because he’s more interested in chasing than cuffing.
After we recorded our episode, more news about Elon Musk emerged from an investigation by Business Insider. Allegedly, Elon Musk exposed himself to a SpaceX flight attendant and propositioned her for sex. The company paid $250,000 for her silence, Business Insider reports. Musk has since denied the harassment claims. Read the entire story here.

Deal of the week
Swyft Cities! The Mountain View–based company, built by Google alums, wants to improve transportation and offer a lower-cost-per-mile vehicle with a smaller carbon emission footprint. The solution looks like an autonomous, lightweight, fixed-cable vehicle. The startup is the winner of the TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility 2022 pitch-off, with Beyond Aero as the runner-up.
Here’s why it’s important: Swyft has checked off a lot of ‘we’re not flailing” boxes. Alongside a MVP and debut customer agreement, the company set up a R&D center in Christchurch, New Zealand. It also works with Remarkables Park in Queenstown, a large office, retail and residential space, to develop a network of autonomous gondolas, TechCrunch reports. It plans to be up and running by August 2024.

"Recent product news from Stripe and Plaid indicate the two private companies are gunning for one another as the market for B2B financial technology matures, expands and individual players increasingly overlap.
It might sound silly that Stripe, best known for its payments technology, and Plaid, best known for its API that connects consumer bank accounts to third-party services, are competing. It isn’t.
The quote, “All software tastes like chicken from a financial perspective” is both funny and true. It’s also largely true for fintech companies, but for a reason unique to the space: Fintech startups, unicorns and even public companies tend to broaden their capabilities over time, adding more and more competencies.
Both B2B and B2C startups have similar motives. Customer acquisition (advertising, onboarding, etc.) is expensive and competitive, so once a fintech lands a user or customer, it’s best to extract as much value from them as possible. That’s why companies like Plaid and Stripe build and buy to serve more and more of their customers’ needs — until they wind up at each other’s doorstep.
What happens once they do? We’re going to find out.
Recent skirmishes from the Great Fintech War
In January 2022, Plaid announced that it was buying Cognito, a decision that TechCrunch wrote was part of a move “beyond merely connecting accounts.” In essence, Cognito added know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-fraud tools to Plaid’s feature list. By doing so, it could offer its customers far more than just account connections.
In 2021, Plaid had bought a company called Flannel that focused on payments. With account connections, security tooling and payments tech, Plaid was building and buying its way into a larger potential total addressable market — one that’s already being attacked by other private fintechs.
It’s obvious that Stripe has broadened its feature set away from its original remit. The company has so many services that its on-site menus are becoming more of a catalog than an organizational tool. Seeing the company launching something new here and there, then, is nothing out of the ordinary.
But in early May, when Stripe announced “Financial Connections,” a service that will, TechCrunch wrote, let its “customers connect directly to their customers’ bank accounts to access financial data to speed up or run certain kinds of transactions,” we took note.
The product announcement put Stripe on a collision course with Plaid’s core business, even if it was fair play — the latter company had already told the market that payments were on its mind through the 2021 Flannel deal.
Still, Plaid clearly took exception with what its leaders implied was a sneaky means of acquiring information and a lack of transparency on Stripe’s part in light of their partnership and history.
With the two companies fussing at one another on Twitter, it was clear that the gloves, as much as they can be in the API world, were off.

"Since its launch in December, StepN, an app that lets users walk and run to earn tokens, has quickly become a household name in the play-to-earn blockchain gaming, or GameFi, world. Two to three million users worldwide are now active on the app every month, StepN’s co-founder Jerry Huang recently told TechCrunch.
That number is nowhere close to the hundred-million player size enjoyed by popular web2 titles, but in the world of crypto, it’s a meaningful breakthrough for a five-month-old app. As of May 22, the market cap of StepN’s native token GMT stood at around $860 million.
Founded by Huang and his co-founder Yawn Rong in Adelaide, Australia, StepN debuted at a Solana hackathon in October. After coming in fourth, its exposure at the event helped land its first batch of beta users. When it officially launched two months later, words about the app that let one earn by staying fit had already spread within the blockchain community. Without any splashy ad campaign, scores of users signed up.
In weeks, StepN was growing so fast that the team needed to cap the number of daily registrations. Now, tens of thousands of new users are joining the app per day, according to Huang.
Huang, a serial entrepreneur, and Rong, a blockchain venture capitalist, were self-funding the project at first for the pair were “financially stable.” But in September, they decided that fundraising could bring in other meaningful resources such as partnerships and publicity. The founders spoke to over 100 investors and revised their pitch deck over 40 times before closing a $5 million seed round from Sequoia Capital and others in November.
“We didn’t have a product at the time, and many investors couldn’t understand what we were doing. Sequoia did. The process of addressing investor questions also helped us refine the product to where it was later,” said Huang.
Indeed, the fast-growing app appears to be self-sustainable for now. It’s generating $3-5 million in net profit from trading fees a day, and earning up to $100 million every month. In April, it picked up another round of strategic investment from Binance.
Is it a game?
Some argue what makes StepN — and other play-to-earn blockchain games like Axie Infinity — successful is the fact that they are essentially financial products with a gamified twist.
To start earning tokens and logging one’s mileage on StepN, users need to first spend at least 12 sol or around $600 on a pair of virtual shoes at the current market rate. The digital shoes are in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT) that runs on the Solana network and Binance’s smart chain so can be resold later, but the entry fee is still not a trivial amount for any casual player.
Over time, StepN users will need to accumulate new kicks to level up. The usual return on investment requires about a month, upon which people can start generating income of up to several thousand dollars per day depending on their level, activeness, and the current price of StepN tokens. In other words, the game can be quite lucrative.
In the eyes of some gaming veterans, the gameplay of most existing GameFi apps is “easy and mindless.” Axie Infinity, for instance, features cute blob-like creatures that fight in simple battles. As such, web2 gaming incumbents are entering GameFi in droves, pledging to bring quality back to the industry.
Huang begged to differ. “A lot of the triple-A games overemphasize aesthetics and big budgets, but they aren’t really that innovative when it comes to gameplay, whereas some simple-looking games like Plants vs. Zombies come with brilliant gameplay that makes them last,” said Huang, who ran his own gaming studio in China before moving to Australia a decade ago.
“Many newcomers to GameFi are blindly pursuing triple-A productions,” he continued. “But if they weren’t already successful in web2, why would they be in web3? Some simple-looking games aren’t that simple behind the scene, for instance, how we design the economics of our app.”
Is it sustainable?
Other critics question the financial sustainability of play-to-earn. Maintaining such a business model means the gameplay needs to be either so addictive that users continue to play without cashing out their coins, or that the app continues to attract new users who buy in only to replace those who cash out. Critics have even drawn parallels between play-to-earn to pyramid schemes.
Axie Infinity hasn’t been able to sustain its meteoric rise. Sky Mavis, the Vietnamese gaming studio behind the game, was valued at $3 billion in a $150 million financing round last October. But its token has lost over 80% of its value since peaking in November at $160, and its sales volume has nosedived from $754 million to just $5 million.
Losing a few thousand dollars isn’t the end of the world for most of StepN’s users, who are 20-40 year-olds from affluent countries like the US, Japan, and Europe. China, where crypto trading is banned, accounts for less than 5% of its user base, Huang said. But Axie Infinity’s players are concentrated in developing countries like the Philippines and Venezuela, many of whom are betting a significant amount of their savings on the game, a major source of their income during the COVID pandemic.
StepN proposes a two-fold solution to sustainability. For one, it’s working on a price stabilization mechanism to ensure the cost of its coins is always at a rate that the shoes are affordable for new users but also not so cheap that existing users lack the incentives to mint new shoes, that is, create new shoes on the blockchain and sell.
Price manipulation is achieved through its dual-token system. When the price of its “utility coin” GST is too high and shoes get pricey, StepN will ask players to burn its “governance coin” GMT to mint new shoes. The supply of GST increases as a result, leading to a sell-off and bringing its cost down.
Huang also argued StepN’s fitness component makes it fundamentally different from Axie Infinity. “Yes, users can make money from StepN in the early stage, but over time they will also grow accustomed to staying active, so they will continue to walk or run regardless of financial rewards.”
“Many people don’t see StepN as a real game. Nor do they consider it a running app because users can make money from it,” said Curt Shi, founding partner at Welinder & Shi Capital and an early investor in StepN. “It’s hard to define what it is right now, but time will tell.”
Killer app?
Huang’s other defense is the role StepN could play in evangelizing blockchain to the world. An estimate of 30% of the app’s users has never used any blockchain services before.
“Many people might have used centralized exchanges like Binance and Coinbase to trade, but few know what a DEX [decentralized exchange] is, nor have they traded NFTs on a marketplace or owned a self-custodial wallet. We have the potential to onboard tens of millions of web3 users and I think this is something very meaningful.”
“I think people are paying too much attention to the [sustainability] issue,” the founder continued. “ROI might slow over time, but all games have life cycles. You also need to look at what value an app creates.”
Momentum might slow down sooner than expected for the app amid crashing crypto values. Venture capital firms are warning startups to brace for a “crypto winter” and industry giants like Coinbase are applying the brakes on hiring. As consumers lose confidence in the market and become less willing to spend on tokens or NFTs, blockchain apps that rely on attracting new users to drive up their economies might face more roadblocks.
But Huang finds a silver lining in the current downturn. “There was a lot of froth in the market. Now the bubble is bursting, our shoes will become more affordable, and only the [blockchain] apps with real use case will survive.”
“The market was clearly frothy, so it’s a good thing that [StepN’s market cap] has shrunk over the past few days,” said Shi. “To maintain an ultra-high market cap can be stressful for the team, and now the team will be focusing more on the product itself and we believe StepN will outperform in bear and will be a winner in the next bull market.”
Operating with a rapidly expanding team of 70 people across countries including Australia, the UK, the US and Singapore, StepN’s next step is to build a social product around its token holder community, the challenge now is to prove that it can continue to draw in a constant stream new runners.

"Hi all!
Welcome back to Week in Review, our newsletter where we wrap up many of the top stories to hit TechCrunch over the last seven days.
The big thing this week, based on what people were reading most, were the details of a memo sent from Y Combinator to its portfolio founders.
As the markets continue to slide,YC is telling its portfolio founders that it’s time to batten down the hatches — cut costs, extend runway and get to a “default alive” state. “For those of you who have started your company within the last 5 years,” YC writes, “question what you believe to be the normal fundraising environment.”

Besides more bad news about the markets, what else was going on?
Apple testing a foldable?: Is Apple tinkering with the idea of folding phones and/or tablets? Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says Apple is testing E-Ink displays for the secondary display on an as-of-yet-unseen “future foldable”. As Brian points out, though, “there’s a big gulf between testing and releasing” — in other words, don’t be too surprised if this one never sees the light of day.
NHTSA probes Tesla crash: Earlier this month, a Tesla Model S “hit a curb and slammed into construction equipment”, killing three. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is now looking into the accident to determine if Tesla’s Autopilot system could’ve been involved.
DOJ says it will no longer prosecute good-faith hackers: After way, way, way too long, the U.S. Justice Department is re-evaluating how it looks at hacking cases, for the first time outright stating that “good-faith security research should not be charged” under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
Haje on Coke’s new bottle cap: “When [Coke] sends out a hand-wringing press release about how awesome they are for launching a bottle cap where the cap stays attached to the bottle ‘for environmental reasons,'” writes Haje, “I’m sorry, my blood just boils.”
PayPal Ventures alums launch a new fund: Within a few months of parting ways with PayPal Ventures, these three alums had raised a huge new fund of their own. The focus? Fintech, and backing “startups that address ‘the biggest hurdles’ in today’s financial infrastructure: access, utility, flexibility, and cost.”

Solo or co-founder?: You’re starting a company. Do you do it alone, or find a co-founder? It’s a question I’ve heard asked pretty much every time I’ve been on a panel with VCs or founders. In this post, co-founder of DocSend (acquired by Dropbox in 2021) Russ Heddleston shares his thoughts.
Are startup layoffs accelerating?: It feels like we’re hearing about new layoffs every other day. How quickly are startup layoffs accelerating? Alex Wilhelm dives into the data.

"Welcome back to The Interchange, the weekly TechCrunch series that looks at the latest — and what’s ahead — in the global fintech industry. It’s an incredible time to be a financial technology journalist. Besides the fact that over 20% of all venture dollars last year went into fintech startups, I am particularly excited about the myriad ways that this technology is helping boost inclusion all over the world. While the pandemic sucked on 1,000 different levels, one silver lining is that consumers and businesses have forced more fintech to exist, and that’s a good thing.

The state of venture
Reporting on startups and the venture world at a time like this is a series of contradictions. One day, we’re reading about investment giants like Tiger Global seeing about $17 billion in losses. Then the next, I open my inbox to see pitches for nine-figure funding rounds (hello, SpotOn) and the birth of new unicorns (looking at you, Unit).
One day, I’m hearing personal accounts of VCs pulling term sheets at the last minute, with some citing that their own investors had backed out of providing funds, leaving founders scrambling to save a round — and face. Then the next, I have a founder telling me their latest round was preempted by a large venture firm in their industry.
One day, I’m having a fintech-focused VC tell me they haven’t invested in any startups since last October. The next, I’m having PayPal Venture alums share news of the closure of a new $158 million fund, ready to back about two dozen early-stage startups through their new firm, Infinity Ventures.
One day, Y Combinator is advising its portfolio founders to “plan for the worst” as startups across the globe scramble to navigate a sharp reversal after a 13-year bull run. The next, Lightspeed Venture Partners is urging founders to “stay optimistic.”
The myriad conflicting signals are enough to make anyone’s head spin, but as journalists, we have to take it all in stride. I’ve come to realize, in reporting on startups and venture capital pretty much exclusively for the past 5 years — and for many more before that in one capacity or another — that nothing is black and white, things aren’t always what they seem and they can change in the blink of an eye. For example, that fund I referred to? It actually closed last October.
During the late ’90s dot.com boom, I remember marveling at the ridiculous amounts of cash being thrown around to startups for sometimes ridiculous ideas. Not gonna lie, there was a similar vibe in 2021, where companies with no revenue, no customers and in some cases, no revenue model even, were landing millions of dollars in funding. It caused me serious anxiety to even open my inbox because the sheer number of pitches was so overwhelming and there were so many startups doing so many similar things, that it got harder and harder to tell them apart.
Here we are today. I have a (slightly) quieter inbox, VCs appear to be applying more (or in some cases, some when there was little to none) due diligence and valuations are either flat or only inching upward rather than soaring — even dropping in some cases. Layoffs abound, just months after headlines of a tech worker shortage in the midst of hiring frenzies. Meanwhile, startups are being held to higher standards when it comes to revenue, customers and profitability. There’s a panic in the air that wasn’t there before as everyone wonders what’s next for founders, investors and startups as a whole.
Is this a market correction or just a shift to the way things should be? Maybe a little of both. Either way, I do think fintech continues to be somewhat of an outlier, at least for now.

Weekly News
The drama between Plaid and Stripe continued this week with the former announcing an expansion outside its core offering of account linking for the first time since its 2013 inception. The news that Plaid is moving into identity and income verification, fraud prevention and account funding was not entirely shocking considering that the startup had made a couple of acquisitions in the past 18 months. It was largely in demand, according to CEO and co-founder Zach Perret, from customers and a desire on its part to “own more of the account funding process.” And it puts Plaid into even more of a competitive position with payments giant Stripe.
Meanwhile, Stripe had news of its own, taking the wraps off Data Pipeline, an infrastructure product that will let its users create links between their Stripe transaction data and data stores that they keep in Amazon Redshift or Snowflake’s Data Cloud.
As our own Ingrid Lunden puts it, the move underscores how Stripe is positioning itself as more than just a payments provider. It has ambitions to be a larger financial services and data powerhouse, a “financial infrastructure platform for businesses” in its own words. Isn’t that what Plaid is?
So, in essence, Plaid is becoming more like Stripe and Stripe is becoming more like Plaid. Not at all confusing.
Plaid’s recent moves are less unexpected than they might seem at the surface — beyond the related recent acquisitions it has made. Recall that Visa almost bought Plaid for $5.3 billion before that deal fell apart in early 2021 due to regulatory concerns. The potential combination first gained a higher level of complexity when, in November 2020, the Department of Justice sued to block Visa’s proposed purchase of Plaid. The DOJ asserted that Visa was buying Plaid to eliminate a competitor in the world of online debit transactions. Visa denied that assertion, stating that Plaid was not a payments company and, therefore, not a direct competitor.
But one of the things that came out at that time was that Visa in fact did view Plaid as a potential competitor, with one executive likening the startup to an island “volcano” whose capabilities at that time were just “the tip showing above the water,” warning that “what lies beneath, though, is a massive opportunity — one that threatens Visa.” And when conducting due diligence in the acquisition process, Visa’s senior executives reportedly grew alarmed by Plaid’s plans to add “a meaningful money movement business by the end of 2021.”
When you look back at that history, Plaid’s recent product announcements are hardly a surprise. If anything, most of us are wondering “What took them so long?” For more on Alex Wilhelm’s and my take on the topic, head here.
Meanwhile, in Mexico, retail brokerage startup Flink, which claims to be the first in its home country to offer fractional shares directly from the New York Stock Exchange, said it will be buying Vifaru Casa de Bolsa, subject to approval from the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV, by its acronym in Spanish). Why is this a big deal? It marks the first time in Mexico that a startup is acquiring a brokerage firm under the supervision of regulatory authorities. Once the deal closes, Flink says it will create new financial products “for millions of Mexicans to invest.”
“At Flink, our mission is to create a much more equitable ecosystem, where anyone can access quality financial services. Therefore, this transaction is a great step toward fulfilling our objective of generating true financial inclusion in the country and the region,” said Flink CEO and co-founder Sergio Jiménez Amozurrutia in a press release.
It’s not the first time that a startup has acquired an existing financial institution. In September 2020, I wrote about how mobile banking startup Jiko Group bought Mid-Central National Bank in Wadena, Minnesota. In that case, both the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco approved the transaction. But it was a process. “The deal came after 3 years of ‘rigorous’ R&D, testing and auditing, the company said.”
More recently, Plaid co-founder William Hockey — who left the company in 2019 — purchased a community bank (Northern California National Bank or NorCal) for $50 million last year. He rebranded it to Column, his latest startup, which he believes is the first financial institution of its kind: a “financial infrastructure” bank.
I find it kind of fascinating when fintechs buy incumbents, and I expect we’ll only continue to see more of it.
Also last week, Square continues to integrate Afterpay into its offering, by extending buy now, pay later (BNPL) functionality to in-person sellers, meaning consumers now can use BNPL to make purchases at local businesses in the United States and Australia. The $29 billion deal closed in January.
Also, in the world of BNPL, London-based Zilch — which was valued at $2 billion last November — announced its launch into the U.S. market. Launching with over 150,000 pre-registered customers, Zilch says its arrival in the U.S. follows a huge growth period, reaching over 2 million customers in the 18 months since it launched in the U.K.
In other (big) BNPL news, the Wall Street Journal reported that Klarna aims to raise up to $1 billion from new and existing backers in a deal that could value the company “at almost a third less than the $45.9 billion valuation it achieved just under a year ago,” or in the value in the low $30-billion-range, post-money. TC’s own Alex Wilhelm has thoughts about that. Read them here.
Meanwhile, Revolut co-founder Nik Storonsky announced that he plans to launch his own venture fund, powered by artificial intelligence, to compete with “legacy” venture capital investors, reports Forbes. Storonsky said he will himself invest, with others, around $200 million into the Quantum Light Capital fund.
And, cryptocurrency exchange FTX said it is launching stock trading capabilities for its customers through its U.S. division. The company, helmed by co-founder and billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, said that its launch will start in private beta mode for a select group of customers chosen from a waitlist before a full rollout in late 2022. Anita Ramaswamy gives us all the details here.

Fundings and M&A
Last week, I (exclusively) covered two raises that related to the residential real estate market, which is an increasing area of interest for VCs as of late. In this case, both were renter-focused. First off, I wrote about Arrived — a proptech that raised $25 million in a Series A funding round led by Forerunner Ventures to give people the ability to buy shares in single-family rentals with “as little as $100.” Returning backers included Bezos Expeditions, the personal investment company of Jeff Bezos; Good Friends, a venture fund run by the CEOs and co-founders of Warby Parker, Harry’s and Allbirds, as well as Spencer Rascoff, co-founder and former CEO of Zillow.
The concept of fractional real estate investing is not a new one. But what stood out about Arrived is that it claims to be the first in the space that is “fully SEC-qualified,” meaning that it has approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer shares of individual homes. In other words, it’s essentially creating house IPOs, or taking houses public. As a former real estate reporter, I can’t help but geek out when tech and real estate intersect. Especially when companies give everyday Americans greater access to investing in a way they couldn’t before.
I also wrote about Belong, a three-sided marketplace that provides services for homeowners who are both landlords and renters.
From the homeowner perspective, Belong offers home management services that it says makes owning a rental home easier. For example, if a rental property needs a repair, the startup has an in-house maintenance team that can handle those on a landlord’s behalf. It also provides the homeowners with financial tools to manage their investment, as well as guaranteed rent on the first of each month. And it will also help an owner fix up a property and get it in rental-ready shape.
On the renters side, Belong says it has created a system that gives them a way to build home ownership themselves. For example, with each one-time rent payment, residents get around 3% of the price of rent back, which accumulates in an account with the aim of being used toward a down payment on the purchase of a home — but only if it’s used to buy a home through its platform. You see, the company serves as a real estate brokerage as well.
Belong just secured $80 million — $50 million in equity and $30 million in debit. Fifth Wall preempted the round, which also included participation from repeat backers Battery Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and GGV Capital.
My favorite line in this story was from Belong CEO and co-founder Ale Resnik, who said part of the company’s goal is to make renters not feel like “second-class citizens.” There’s a bigger story here on why startups focused on the rental market seem to be attracting venture dollars. One of these days, I’ll write it.
Meanwhile, infrastructure continues to rake in the big bucks. Xendit, a payments infrastructure platform for Southeast Asia, raised $300 million in fresh funding. The company’s new valuation wasn’t disclosed, but it hit unicorn status in its last round of funding in September 2021. And, BaaS startup Unit closed on a $100 million round at a $1.2 billion valuation. Speaking of infrastructure, payments infra startup Finix announced some new product news last week, including the fact that it is now a registered payment facilitator and has expanded its in-person payments capabilities and added real-time fraud monitoring.
In LatAm, UnDosTres, a Mexican fintech company working on airtime top-ups, service payments and entertainment purchases, announced it closed on a $30 million Series B led by IDC Investments.
And Nomad, a Brazilian fintech company that allows Brazilians to open a 100% digital banking/investment account in a North American bank, raised $32 million just 9 months after their first round. Stripes led the latest financing. The company says it has amassed 300,000 customers in less than 18 months of operations. Speaking of Brazil, check out this feature I did on Neon, a digital bank with 16 million customers in its home country focused on the working class.
Trellis, a company that wants to help people pay less money for their car insurance and make it easier to switch with its API, raised $5 million from Amex Ventures.
Caribou, a fintech whose mission is to help people take control of their car payments, closed on $115 million in an “oversubscribed” Series C funding round, which valued the company at $1.1 billion. Goldman Sachs Asset Management led the financing, expanding its services across the auto financial landscape, recently launching its digital car insurance marketplace.
That’s it for this week…Wishing you all a wonderful Sunday and week ahead. Thanks for reading!

"The inevitable physics of economics is upon us — what goes up must come down — and we appear to be headed for the down part of the equation.
But all is not lost. If you need a reminder, Venmo, Instagram, Uber and WhatsApp all launched during the Great Recession of 2008.
When I think about recessions, I remember what an electrician said while working on my house during the dot-com blowup. I’d asked him if he was worried about the economy affecting his work, and as he drilled another hole for the wiring, he looked up at me and said, “Nah. A bad economy just weeds out the hacks.”
If your company is lacking basic business fundamentals and burning cash, well, maybe you’re in for a reckoning. But then again, maybe you always were. But if you have a well-grounded startup built on a good idea with a solid foundation, you can probably ride out whatever storm is coming.
The question is this: Are you building something essential at the core of your customer’s business, which Operator Collective founder and CEO Mallun Yen refers to as painkillers? Or are you building something less essential, which she calls vitamins?
Painkillers versus vitamins
“Companies building painkillers rather than vitamins, especially solutions that are technically hard or tricky to develop, or anticipate fundamental but yet-to-be-mainstream shifts in an industry, are particularly well positioned to weather the macro conditions that are out of their control. Painkillers include products that increase revenue or significantly lower costs in a tangible way,” Yen told me.
She said those startups can be in any category as long as they are helping companies work smarter, which is even more essential in an uncertain economy.
“For instance, we have one company we are investing in that enables customers to significantly increase their sales by enabling them to do things in a way that hasn’t been done before. Another is materially lowering cloud infrastructure spend — a pain point that will only increase for companies across the board as more data is stored in the cloud and corresponding queries and other analysis need to be run.”
Derek Zanutto, general partner at CapitalG, said that while many companies will experience some short-term hiccups due to market fluctuations, his firm still expects to see many grow and thrive over the coming years.
“Some of the greatest companies have been founded or emerged stronger than ever during weakened market conditions. I’m particularly bullish on startups that are helping enterprises harness the power of their data. Data, when leveraged well, can help enterprises both rein in costs and generate more money, making it, over the long term, a recession-proof business sector,” Zanutto said.
Soma Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures, said his firm has been investing in intelligent applications, adding that regardless of what’s happening in the macro environment, they are sticking to the plan.

"Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.
The app industry continues to grow, with a record number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the latest year-end reports. App Annie says global spending across iOS and Google Play is up to $135 billion in 2021, and that figure will likely be higher when its annual report, including third-party app stores in China, is released next year. Consumers also downloaded 10 billion more apps in 2021 than in 2020, reaching nearly 140 billion in new installs, it found.
Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a combined $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors poured $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that was up 27% year-over-year.
This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and much more.

Apps celebrate Global Accessibility Awareness Day
This past Thursday, May 19, 2022, marked the 11th Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD), which is a day focused on raising awareness about digital access and inclusion for the more than 1 billion people who live with disabilities or impairments. A number of app makers and tech companies took part in GAAD this year to either highlight or announce new features designed to better meet the needs of those with vision impairment, hearing loss and other disabilities.
Instagram’s @creators account shared information with its community about how and why to use accessibility features, like alt-text and auto-generated captions to create a better experience for your audience. The company also noted other developments it had rolled out, like dark mode, screen reader improvements, improved automatic and custom alternative text options for people with vision impairments, caption stickers for Reels and Stories, and more. The company also said it has started rolling out closed caption features to improve the Instagram experience for the deaf and hard of hearing communities. These changes help to improve the experience for everyone, however, as Instagram said one-third of video plays on Instagram are with the sound off. In March, Instagram made auto-generated captions the default for creators, which are supported globally across iOS and Android.
Google shared its approach to both hiring people with disabilities and building products to meet their needs. For example, it highlighted projects like Project Relate, a communication tool for people with speech impairments; the update to TalkBack, Android’s built-in screen reader; and the improved Select-to-Speak Chromebook tool; a multi-pin feature for Google Meet, which allows users to pin multiple tiles, like a presenter’s screen and interpreter’s screen. The company also noted all its English-language YouTube Originals content from the past year — and moving forward — will now have English audio descriptions available globally.
Apple, meanwhile, participated in GAAD with a number of announcements about new accessibility features for iPhone, Apple Watch and Mac.
These included a universal Live Captions feature, improved visual and auditory detection modes and iOS access to WatchOS apps. Live Captions will be able to transcribe any audio content, like FaceTime calls, video conferencing apps and streaming video, as well as in-person conversations, all in English to start.

Apple’s Sound Recognition feature will be able to be programmed to recognize sounds unique to a person’s own home, like their doorbell or appliances. The Magnifier app will add a new ML and lidar-powered Door Detection feature within a new Detection Mode section. This will help users locate a door, understand how far they are from it and describe door attributes. Apple Maps will offer sound and haptics feedback for VoiceOver users. And Apple Watch will help users control Apple Watch remotely from their paired iPhone with Apple Watch Mirroring. It also gains new Quick Action like a double-pinch gesture to answer or end a phone call, dismiss a notification, take a photo, play or pause media in the Now Playing app, and start, pause or resume a workout.
Snap’s platform policies for third-party apps aren’t yet fully enforced
Image Credits: TechCrunch
A handful of Snap Kit platform developers have not yet complied with the new guidelines around anonymous messaging and friend-finding apps announced in March. The Snapchat maker revamped its developer platform policies on March 17, 2022, to ban anonymous apps and require developers to build friend-finding apps to limit access to users 18 or older. The policy changes were effective immediately and existing developers were given 30 days to come into compliance — a date that would have passed last month.
It is now mid-May and some developers of the newly banned and restricted apps are not yet meeting Snap’s new requirements.
Snap confirmed to TechCrunch a small number of apps were given extensions, including anonymous apps LMK and Send It. But others seemed to be working around Snap’s ban with their friend-finding apps marketed to users ages 12+, instead of the now required 18+. They got away with this by not actually using the SDK — something impossible to tell from their App Store marketing and screenshots which imply they’re directly integrated with Snap’s features. Another app had flown under the radar, continuing to operate in violation of the rules unless TechCrunch pointed it out, resulting in a belated ban. This lack of clarity on which apps are platform apps, and which are only pretending to be, could complicate things for Snap, which is engaged in litigation over bullying-related suicides. And like all social media, the company could be under new U.S. regulation related to child safety matters in the future, as well.

Snapchat’s stricter policies for anonymous apps and friend finders aren’t yet fully enforced

Twitter deal still a go… for now
First, Elon Musk tweeted that the Twitter deal was “temporarily on hold” until Twitter could prove the percentage of spambots on its platform was actually less than 5%, as it reports. This Tuesday, he reiterated the deal would not move forward until Twitter would show him proof of this <5% figure. Twitter was having none of it, though. The company filed a proxy statement, saying it’s committed to the deal as agreed and is ready to close “as promptly as possible.”
If Musk’s move was an attempt to renegotiate the price, it didn’t seem to be working. Twitter’s top lawyer and head of policy, Vijaya Gadde, told staff at an all-hands meeting there’s “no such thing as a deal being on hold,” reported Bloomberg. Twitter execs also suggested that it could try to enforce the deal terms in court, if need be, but said that would be “pretty rare” for such a thing to occur. (Not that this Twitter deal is proceeding normally though!) There’s still some speculation that Musk is looking to fully back out and will find a way to do so, billion-dollar breakup fee notwithstanding. In the meantime, the bankers are still preparing the paperwork and execs are still leaving. This week, it was Twitter Service VP Katrina Lane, head of data science Max Schmeiser and VP of product management Ilya Brown — all of whom chose to leave on their own.
Apple’s new rules let apps raise subscription prices automatically
Image Credits: TechCrunch
Alongside the launch of the iOS 15.5 update, Apple introduced a new set of rules to govern auto-renewing subscriptions on the App Store. Now, instead of asking users to agree to any subscription price increases, developers will be able to roll out a price increase with the user’s explicit consent. The feature allows developers to simply inform customers they’ll be charged more, but not require the customer to opt-in to the higher pricing.
We first broke the news that Apple was pilot testing this program last month, when it appeared Disney+ subscription customers had simply been told their price was increasing but weren’t asked for their consent. Apple then confirmed this was the result of a “new commerce feature” it planned to launch soon, which it said would be “great for both developers and users.”
Apple’s position is that this could save customers the hassle of having their subscriptions automatically canceled just because they didn’t see the notification or email that asked them to opt in to the price increase.
“This has led to some services being unintentionally interrupted for users and they must take steps to resubscribe within the app, from Settings on iPhone and iPad, or in the App Store on Mac,” the company explained in its announcement on Monday.
However, the flip side of this argument is that those same customers who would have missed the consent notification will likely be the same ones who would now miss the notification informing them their subscription will be increasing in price. There’s also an argument here that this change could enable unscrupulous developers and scammers to better profit from their victims if Apple doesn’t carefully enforce the program rules.
Currently, those state that developers can’t increase prices more than once per year. The increase also can’t exceed 50% of the subscription price, and the difference in price can’t exceed $5 USD per period for non-annual subscriptions or $50 USD for annual subscriptions.
Weekly News
Platforms: Apple

Apple released the first public betas of iOS 15.6, iPadOS 15.6, tvOS 15.6, watchOS 8.7 and macOS 12.5. Now included in the beta lineup is HomePod Software 15.6.
Apple also released iOS 15.5 to the public, which included a new way to request and send money from their Apple Cash card through the Wallet app, as well as a slew of new features for the Apple Podcasts app, and other features.
The latest Swift Playgrounds update (ver. 4.1) added App Store Connect integration for macOS users.
Apple targeted data brokers in its latest ad that promotes iOS privacy features.


Platforms: Google

Google Play expanded its app sanctions against Russia to include Belarus. The company will block the download of paid apps and updates to paid apps in both Russia and Belarus, it said in an update to its help article on the matter.
Alongside its announcement of its new Fire 7 tablet, Amazon also revealed that its upcoming Fire OS 8, its own Android-based OS, will launch in June.
An update to the Google System Update changelog again indicates that Google’s Family Link software will allow parents to set a persistent launcher on their child’s supervised device. This would make it so that a child couldn’t change the phone’s launcher to do anything other than what’s approved. The feature hasn’t been publicly announced.

E-commerce and Food Delivery

Uber announced a partnership with Grocery Outlet to pilot on-demand and scheduled grocery delivery. Initially, users can shop at 72 Grocery Outlet stores in California, Oregon and Washington state via the Uber or Uber Eats app.
Uber also announced a whole host of new features at its global product event earlier in the week. Here, Uber launched an “Uber Travel” feature that helps riders pre-book rides to and from upcoming events, like flights or restaurant reservations. It also announced an Uber Charter service for booking party buses, passenger vans and coach buses; plus event vouchers, an EV and charging map, various new Uber Eats products and additional perks for its Uber One membership; and more.
Snapchat and eBay announce integrations. Snapchat users can now share eBay listings with their friends using the Snapchat Camera on Android and iOS.
YouTube teased new features that it claims will make it easier for viewers to discover and buy from brands. One new feature will allow two creators to go live at the same time to co-host a single live shopping stream. This could effectively double the draw for the event, as each creator would bring their own fanbase to the stream. Another upcoming option is called “live redirects.” With this, creators are able to start a shopping livestream on their channel, then redirect their audience over to a brand’s channel for fans to keep watching. This allows brands to tap into the power of the creator’s platform and reach their fanbase, but then gives the brands themselves access to that audience — and the key metrics and analytics associated with their live event — directly on their own YouTube channel.

Fintech

FTX US plans to launch FTX Stocks, a zero-commission stock trading feature available through the FTX mobile app, rolling out in the U.S. in the “coming months.” The news is particularly notable given that billionaire FTX US founder Sam Bankman-Fried recently acquired a 7.6% stake in Robinhood.
Robinhood will launch a standalone app that lets users hold their own cryptocurrencies and NFTs, putting it in direct competition with Coinbase and startups like MetaMask or Rainbow. The move comes at a time when Robinhood’s stocks are off by more than 70% since its IPO.
Coinbase backtracked on its hiring plans, citing the crypto market turmoil. The company had earlier planned to triple headcount this year, but is now reassessing its headcount needs.
Coinbase also said it would let a “small set” of users access Ethereum-based decentralized apps directly from its own app via the new dApp browser. The feature would allow users to purchase NFTs on OpenSea and Coinbase’s NFT platform; trade on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and SushiSwap; and borrow and lend through DeFi platforms like Curve and Compound.
Plaid, whose service powers a number of fintech aps, announced two products for ACH transfers, including identity verification, putting it into competition with Stripe.
Greenlight, a $2.3 billion fintech focused on kids, launched a credit card for parents. The Greenlight-branded card, offered through Mastercard, offers up to 3% unlimited cash back on all purchases and gives parents the option to automatically invest those cash rewards in stocks and ETFs. They also can choose to invest the cash in other ways through the Greenlight mobile app or transfer funds to their bank.

Social

TikTok launched Branded Mission, a new ad product that lets advertisers crowdsource content from creators with at least 1,000 followers. Advertisers can launch branded campaigns by developing a brief and releasing it to the creator community, encouraging them to participate in Branded Missions. Eligible creators whose videos are selected by brands will then benefit from a cash payment and boosted traffic.
TikTok launched its first creator crediting tool to help video creators cite their inspiration for dances, jokes, sounds and other content. The tool allows a creator to pick a video that’s then automatically added to their own video’s caption, linking back to the original creator. The changes follow years of complaints that top TikTok stars were lifting choreography from smaller creators, often Black creators. The problem got so bad that last year, some Black creators went on strike, refusing to create new dance moves for a recently dropped Megan Thee Stallion single as a form of protest.

Twitter rolled out the ability for creators to host Super Follows-only Spaces as a subscriber perk. Subscribers globally on iOS and Android will be able to join and request to speak in Super Follows-only Spaces. (Web users can only join and listen for now.) Users who aren’t Super Following a creator can still see the Space but won’t be able to access it unless they subscribe.
Snap announced its new Snap Originals shows, which were also recently previewed at a company event. The show features stars like Simone Biles, winner of 32 Olympic and World Championship medals; NAACP Image Award winner La’Ron Hines; Dixie and Charli D’Amelio; and others.
Facebook and Twitter struggled to contain the Buffalo shooting video which was circulating across their platforms where it was being reported by end users. The New York AG also announced plans to investigate Twitch, Discord and 4chan for their role in the mass shooting.
Snap-owned social maps app Zenly, used by 35 million people monthly, rolled out its own mapping data and engine following last month’s redesign. The project was built using open source data from OpenStreetMap and acquired datasets from third parties. The maps feature 3D landmarks, animated effects, tiny cars, people, 3D trees and more. The new maps are live in Taipei, Tokyo, Paris, Los Angeles, New York and Seoul.

Photo and video-editing app Picsart laid off 90 employees, or around 8% of its workforce, amid the market downturn.

Dating

Regulatory filings indicated Tiger Global sold off its entire stake in Bumble, along with other apps like Airbnb and Didi, as well as ~80% of its stake in Robinhood during 2022’s tech stock sell-off, FT reported.
Match Group-owned Hinge introduced a new feature aimed at helping users initiate conversations about self-care. The new Self-Care Prompts may include things like “The last time I cried happy tears was…,” “My friends ask me for advice about…,” “To me, relaxation is…,” “I feel most supported when…,” “A boundary of mine is…,” and others.

Messaging

Meta launched its free WhatsApp Cloud API, aimed at SMBs, to all businesses worldwide after earlier beta testing. The API allows companies to build on top of WhatsApp to better serve their customers, but without the costs and longer integration time for the on-premise version. WhatsApp also said it would roll out paid features for its WhatsApp Business app later this year, including things like the ability to manage chats across up to 10 devices. The company will also provide new customizable WhatsApp click-to-chat links that help businesses attract customers across their online presence, it said.
WhatsApp is also developing a feature that will allow users to stealthily exit group chats without informing the group, according to a leak from WABetaInfo. The feature was developed for the new Communities feature rolling out slowly this year.
Indian users of the Google Messages app say RCS is being abused by businesses to spam users with ads, with the frequency of the ads picking up over the past few months.
Apple’s Communication Safety in Messages expanded to more countries with iOS 15.5, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K.

Streaming & Entertainment

YouTube’s player gained new features, including Most Replayed, Video Chapters for big-screen devices, Single Loop and more. The company said it’s adding a graph that people can use to easily locate and watch the most replayed parts of a video — something that could be particularly helpful for longer videos or those that haven’t broken down their various sections using either timestamps or video chapters. It also rolled out Video Chapters to smart TVs and gaming consoles and an option to set a video on a looping mode.
Apple Music launched Apple Music Live, a new recurring series that will livestream concerts from major artists, kicking off with a Harry Styles concert Friday at 9 PM ET alongside the release of his third album, “Harry’s House.” Encore streams will run at 12:00 PM ET on  May 22 and 5 AM ET on May 26. Apple wouldn’t say if VOD streams would ever be available.
Spotify and Accenture teamed up in order to offer Spotify Premium as an employee perk as part of a new offering called “Spotify for Work.” Accenture kicked off the deal by rolling out Spotify to its employees across Sweden, Latvia and Lithuania.

Charli XCX is scheduled to play a “metaverse” concert on Roblox on June 17, 2022, at 7 PM ET. The concert will follow a five-week virtual event comprising mini-games and other digital challenges.
The Apple Podcasts app gained new storage clean-up tools, support for annual subscriptions and a new distribution system. The new Apple Podcasts Delegated Delivery system will soon allow creators to more easily distribute their podcasts directly to Apple Podcasts from third-party hosting providers, including Acast, ART19, Blubrry, Buzzsprout, Libsyn, Omny Studio and RSS.com. The clean-up tools, meanwhile, will come in handy for better controlling how many episodes are saved locally and give you a chance to bulk remove downloads for the first time, including on Mac.

Gaming

Fortnite launched to all iOS users via Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service after a few months of closed beta trials. The launch means iPhone users have yet another workaround to play the popular game on their device, despite its ban from the App Store, following Fortnite’s launch on Microsoft’s Cloud Gaming service earlier this month.
A report from Reuters said TikTok was testing HTML5 games in Vietnam, but TikTok told TechCrunch that was inaccurate — no games were currently testing in that market. However, the company had previously confirmed it was engaged in further gaming partnership discussions after its Zynga deal was announced.
TechCrunch also reported and confirmed a separate effort focused on bringing interactive minigames — like “Draw & Guess” — to the TikTok LIVE platform.
Niantic’s Pokémon GO partnered with Amazon Prime Gaming and Prime Student to offer exclusive bonus item bundles every two weeks to Prime members. Users can log in to Prime and get a code, which they can redeem on Niantic’s rewards page. The items will then appear in the game.

Security & Privacy

Brave’s iOS web browser was updated with a new Privacy Hub feature that offers users more visibility on exactly what Brave blocked, and how Brave protects your personal information online. It does so by showing a rolling update of how many trackers Brave blocked on a specific site, or in a given time span. The hub also offers education about trackers and privacy threats.
Apple patched almost 30 security flaws with iOS 15.5, as well as over 50 fixes for macOS 12.4.

Funding and M&A
💰 Pintarnya, a startup building a super app for Indonesia’s blue-collar workers, raised $6.3 million in seed funding led by Sequoia Capital India and General Catalyst. The funding includes a $100,000 grant from Sequoia Spark, a program for women founders. The app offers verified job postings and financial services, like loans, for blue-collar workers.
💰 Instant delivery app Gopuff, valued at $15 billion, announced a new advisor and investor: Bob Iger, the former CEO and chairman of The Walt Disney Company.

💰 Instabug, a startup that helps mobile developers monitor, identify and fix bugs within apps, raised $46 million in Series B funding led by Insight Partners. The company said its ARR doubled in 2021 and the number of enterprise customers grew 10x, as it added new clients like DoorDash, Verizon, Qualtrics, Porsche and Gojek.
